ZTL [<filespec>] [/b] [/d] [/i] [/t<archive-type>] [/w<drive:>] [/?]

    <filespec> - The file(s) to convert; can include any
                    a path and wildcards (default is *.zip).
            /b - Update FILES.BBS after archive conversion.
                    (for Maximus bbs use).
            /d - do NOT delete the original archive when
                    done. (default deletes original)
            /i - do NOT convert internal archives of the
                    same extention as in <filespec>.
            /t - declare extension of the target archive.
                    (default is LZH)
            /w - declare a work drive (not directory).
            /? / quick help screen


IMPORTANT:
    You  must  edit  the  first  few lines of the program to make sure
    that YOUR archivers are defined correctly.  This is  not  hard  to
    do,  and  the  area  that you need to chang is clearly marked out.
    Take a look at the program with a text editor  and  you  will  see
    what to  do.    As many archivers as you want can be defined using
    the following format (where EXT  is  the  file  extension  of  the
    archiver):

        EXT.1='archiver unarchive_command'
        EXT.2='archiver archive_command'

    ie.
        ZIP.1='PKUNZIP2'
        ZIP.2='PKZIP2'
        LZH.1='LH X'
        LZH.2='LH A'

NOTES:
        - Just in case you run dos or windoze and haven't
            realized it yet... this is for OS/2!!
        - for best preformance put ZTL.CMD somewhere in
            your path statement, naturally.
        - If you just type ZTL with no parameters the
            default will convert all ZIPs in the current
            directory, including internal archives, to
            LZH then delete the original archive files.
        - Put the arguments in any order on the end of
            the command line after the file name.
        - <filespec> can include wildcards but wants an
            idenifying extension (ie. *.zip or t*.zip);
            however if no extension is given the extension
            '.zip' will be added.
        - <filespec> can include drives and paths.
        - If you chose as target archive the same as the
            original the original archive will be over-
            written regardless of the /d flag.
        - Immeditately folling the archiver definitions there
            is a short section where you can define commands
            to execute on the files in you archive before it
            is rearchived.  In this way you can scan for
            viruses and/or delete unwanted files.  See the
            examples in the program with a text editor.
            (Delete the sample commands if you don't want them).
        - the /w work drive switch only wants a drive
            (ie. e:, d:, etc) and not a directory.
            If you give a directory it will be ignored.
        - for Maximus/2 sysops the /b switch should be
            invaluable as it will update your FILES.BBS.
        - To run ZTL to convert all archive types in a
            directory you should create a .cmd file
            that runs ZTL for each file extenstion you
            want to be convertered.
        - With this realease long archive names with
            spaces in them are not supported... though
            long file names with no spaces should work.
            I don't have enough RAM to run HPFS so I
            haven't been able to test it out yet.  I will
            add this feature if interest is shown.
        - Archive file will be output in upper case.

Please feel free to send me any suggestions or compliments.
If you change my code please send me an update!!  I want the
better version <g>.  I'm on FidoNet at Tim Middleton 1:250/202.
