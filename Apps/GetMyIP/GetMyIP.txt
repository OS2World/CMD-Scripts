GetMyIP ReadMe - Release 1.0.8
==============================

NAME
   GetMyIP.EXE

SYNOPSIS
   This short program will retrieve the Internet IP address assigned to the 
   host PC. The information is retrieved from an external ECHO SERVER.
   
DESCRIPTION
   A little background first. There are (as far as the scope of this program is 
   concerned) 2 separate Internet IP address types assigned to a host PC, they 
   are either static or	dynamic IP addresses. Typically hosts with a static 
   Internet IP address never change and are directly reachable through internet. 
   This means that there are no other devices between this host PC and it's 
   Internet connection. The other situation is where a host PC sits behind a NAT
   router/firewall where on a LAN it may have a dynamic or a static IP address 
   assigned, but externally the Internet IP address assigned to the router is 
   really how this host PC is known to the outside world. This script is meant 
   to retrieve that external Internet IP address by which the host PC is known 
   to the outside world. This is typically the case when dealing with the 
   standard dial-up, DSL, Cable modem ISP accounts.

   In additon, if the external IP address assigned to the user's connection 
   (through the router or directly the PC itself) changes dynamically the script
   can be re-run to show the new resulting IP address. This is actually the 
   reason why I developed the code. I have a DSL connection to my ISP, it does 
   not change frequently, in fact it only seems to change if I specifically 
   disconnect and re-connect. I wanted an easy and reliable way of retrieving 
   my ISP assigned IP address. On my LAN I have several PCs which all have a 
   static IP address assigned to them. If I issue one of the standard TCP/IP 
   commands to retrieve the host PC IP address I would get the following:

   command: hostid
   result: 192.168.1.10

   As you can tell the IP address returned is my LAN static IP address, not the 
   external Internet IP address which has been assigned to my DSL connection by 
   my ISP. Since I wanted to run some Internet services on one of my machines I 
   needed a way to retrieve that external address.

   your Internet IP address.
