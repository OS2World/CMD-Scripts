DNSAlias-NET
Version: 3
Author: Vinicius Beltrao
Support Contact: Bruce Dudley - os2box@transit.homeip.net
Website: http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/internet/dynip/DNSAlias-NET.zip
Operating System: OS/2(tested on warp4 & Wseb, probably works on warp3 too)
Requires: rxsock.dll

Features:

 Both enables/disables your current IP number on any domain belonging to the
 dyndns.org free services family. Easy to use. If you registered on more than
 one domain just use: update yourhostname.domain.ext yourlogin yourpasswd online
 or update yourhostname.domain.ext yourlogin yourpasswd suspend (this one
 disables your current IP making it show as being 255.255.255.255).

 i.e.: add the DNS-?? programs to your ILINK/2 (or INJOY/2) dialer so it will
 update your ip as soon as the connection to the net has been established. This
 client is offered AS-IS, it's a freeware client. Since it's a simple REXX
 based program no bug has been found at all but still use it at your own risk,
 the only guarantee I give you is that you are reading this text now and that
 the program works nicely for me and for the other users who have tried it so
 far.
