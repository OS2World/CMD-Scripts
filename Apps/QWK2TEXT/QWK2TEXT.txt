      Version:    3.5
      Warranty:   Guaranteed to occupy space on your disk

      History:
         3.1 - first release
         3.5 - added abilty to return only messages that contain a pattern
               provided on command line.
             - added defaults for commandline args

      Purpose:
      This utility reads QWK-format messages.dat files as found in a QWK
      download and converts the messages to ASCII text. If a pattern is
      included it will extract only messages that contain that pattern. The
      pattern match is case sensitive.

      Usage:
      1) Unpack a .QWK message packet
      2) Look for a file called messages.dat. It's there.
      3) Run this REXX program. Use the > character to redirect the output
         to a file. That's it! The file will be coverted to a text file.

         qwk2text [messages.dat] [pattern] (defaults: messages.dat ---)      

      If no args are provided messages.dat is assumed and all messages
      will be extracted using --- for pattern.
