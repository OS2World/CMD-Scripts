This is my own work and it works for me and does not 
(to the best of my knowledge) cause any harm.  
Running the REXX cmd file is your acceptance of user onus.
If your motherboard melts or your dog gets run down by a 
bus or your spouse leaves you I accept absolutely NO

I am in no way connected to the makers of In-joy internet dialer.
I am merely a user of it with too much spare time on my hands.

----------------

If you're like me and your ISP only gives you a set number of hours per 
calender month online time, and you use in-joy, it can be easy to lose 
track of how many hours you've used.  I've written this with that in mind.
You may also find it useful as a monitoring tool.

Until in-joy internet dialer incorporates a time online/month calculator 
this will do it for you.

A simple rexx script that interrogates your log files to calculate your 
monthly online time.  Place the .cmd file in your in-joy directory and
run it from a command line.  it will display a list of *.log files you have
and a number corresponding to each one. 
eg
----------
1 E:\in-joy\Conn3656.log                      /* the first 4 letters are the     */
2 E:\in-joy\default.log                         /* first 4 letters of the provider */
3 E:\in-joy\dial1156.log			 /* name...default is the default.  */
4 E:\in-joy\Subu8218.log			 /* provider from in-joy           */
CHOOSE THE LOG TO ANALYSE
----------
^ enter the number from the left column

next you'll be asked to choose which month.  it MUST be 2 digit (ie 01-12)

----------
what month ? jan=01 feb=02...dec=12
----------

enter a two digit month number and you'll be shown your online
time usage for that provider for the month shown eg.

----------
total time online for month 12 = 876 minutes for this ISP

total time online for month 12 = 14.6 hours for this ISP
----------

It does not incorporate the year yet.  But I'll add that if I get requests.  I may even 
try to automate it further if there's demand for it. eg defaulting to the current month.

I hope someone finds this useful.  Email me with any comments / flames.

The rexx is only pretty basic.  It's only my second attempt at using Rexx and 
I'm only learning as I go, with only the online REXX manuals as my guide.
Feel free to hack it to customise it to your needs, though I would appreciate 
if you could send me a copy of your hack.
