EditSubj User's Guide v0.2				    06 Jan 2005
==========================

EditSubj does in place editing of mail message Subject lines.  It was
originally implemented to clean up the sorting of oddly formed Re: phrases
which the default MR2/ICE sort does not order to my taste.


Installation
============

The preferred install location is the MR/2 ICE Scripts subdirectory, but the
script may be installed elsewhere as long as you don't get too creative.


Usage
=====

The usual way to run EditSubj is to run it from an Incoming filter.  For
best performance, match on the subject to be edited before invoking the
script.

As with all filters, EditSubj expects the message file name to passed on the
command line.  There are no addition command line switches or
arguments available.


Customizing
===========

EditSubj is REXX, so you can modify it to do more or less than it currently
does.

To add additional replacement strings to the predefined set, add entries to
the MatchList and ReplList stems.  Do not forget to adjust the stem item count.

EditSubj is optimized for speed so it does an in place edit of the message.
This means the line length is not allowed not change.  To implement this
restriction, spaces are appended, as needed, to the end of the edited line.

If you want to implement something that requires the line lengths to change,
you will need to read the message body into memory, edit it in memory and
rewrite the entire message.  If you shorten the message length, you will need
to delete the file before rewriting it.
