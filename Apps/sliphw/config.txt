Configuring the programs
========================

Here are all the files that need configuring, with notes on each. If you go
through the configuration in the order the files are listed, you can get
parts of the package working and test them separately.

All files are Rexx except the SLIP configuration files. I've put all the
data that needs to be configured at the start of the Rexx files. Below is a
list of all files that need configuration and the settings that must be made.

Some data has to be entered in several files. Ideally, there should be a
file called \TCPIP\ETC\SLIPHW.INI which contains all the key data. Then I
could make this package read all the data from there and you wouln't have
to change the files. Maybe in a future version.

Required information for each PC
--------------------------------

Get all this information before you start. You'll need it for both PCs.

COM port, speed
Modem init string, reset string, hangup string,
      strings to go into answer mode, and out of answer mode
      string to hang up
      string received on CONNECT
Phone numbers of home and work PCs
IP addresses of both PC's at each end of the slip interface. Note that a
   PC on Ethernet must have two IP addresses, one for the Ethernet
   interface and one for the slip interface. We only need the slip IP.
Net mask (probably 255.255.255.0)
Name of Ethernet interface of PC we connect to. (Machine name on the Internet)
   Note that a PC with an Ethernet card will have two interfaces with two
   machine names. We don't care about slip interfaces here, just Ethernet
   interfaces.
Ethernet card hardware (MAC) addresses for all Ethernet cards present
User name for logging in remote PC
Password for logging in remote PC
If you want sounds, choose wav files to play on connect

start daemons. You should add or delete daemons according to what you have
running and want to run.

the slip server starts. Lines in the file that start daemons are commented
out. Remove the comments.

Configuring the COM port
========================


MODE115.CMD
-----------
This comes set up for COM2. This locks the serial port speed.


MODE576.CMD
-----------
This comes set up for COM1. This doesn't lock the speed.

===========================================================================
Starting Daemons
================


STAFTPD.CMD
-----------
The ftp daemon may have to be started from the drive and directory where it
resides. I happen to have a copy of Warp Connect on drive L: so this file
switches to the \TCPIP\BIN directory for Warp Connect and runs the FTP daemon
that came with Warp Connect. If you don't use Warp Connect you might try
the Penquin FTP daemon. This file must run whatever daemon you get.


STAGOSRV.CMD
------------

I've got GoServ installed on drive K:. This switches to that drive and
GoServ's home directory and runs it.
