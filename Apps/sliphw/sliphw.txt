SLIP-HOME-WORK (SLIPHW or SHW) Version 1.0 beta

Overview
========

SHW is a collection of Rexx scripts which will do the following:

(1) HOMESRVD.CMD: Runs your PC as a SLIP server so a remote machine can log
in. It isn't much use unless your PC is already running daemons like ftpd.
You must run daemons. These programs talk to other machines on the Internet. If
you don't run daemons, other machines cannot interact with your PC, even if you're
on the Internet.

(2) HOMESERV.CMD: Runs HOMESRVD to make your home PC as a SLIP server, and
then starts various daemons. HOMESERV.CMD starts an FTP daemon, and the Web
Server GoServe. You should modify HOMESERV.CMD so it runs your favorite
daemons.

(3) WORKSRVD.CMD: Runs your work PC as a SLIP server. The package assumes as a
default that the work machine is on the Internet with an Ethernet card. When
another machine connects to the work PC, routing is set up so the other PC can
access the Internet.

(4) HOME2WRK.CMD: Connects to your work PC from home. Logs in with password.

(5) WORK2HOM.CMD: Connects to your home PC from work. Logs in with password.

(6) AUTONETH.CMD: Automates everything on a home PC. Give AUTONETH a list of
jobs to do on the Internet and AUTONETH will connect from home using HOME2WRK,
run each of the jobs, and disconnect from the Internet.

(7) AUTONETW.CMD: Same as AUTONETH, but for the machine at work. Runs WORK2HOM.

(8) CRONTAB.HW:  This will log onto the Internet every 10 minutes, set your
PC's  clock, and disconnect from the Internet. This will repeat forever. It
requires the Rexx version of CRON, called CRONRGF. (Available as CRONRGF2.ZIP
on most FTP sites) and the time setting program NISTIME.EXE (NISTIME.ZIP).
CRON is a scheduling program that runs jobs at specific times. CRONRFG
consists of 4 Rexx files which must be on your path. Run "cronrgf crontab.hw"
to set your clock every 10 minutes. Modify CRONTAB.HW to do whatever you want
at whatever times you want.

The Rexx scripts also have some code that should work if you have a home
Ethernet. The variable "Ethercard" in these scripts is set to 'T' or 'F'
according to whether or not the machine has an Ethernet card. By default the
work machine is assumed to have a card, but the home machine isn't. If you
have a home ethernet, try changing "Ethercard" to T. It may work, but it
probably need some tuning. I haven't tested this. My son took the other
machine on our home Ethernet off to UVic. My home Ethernet isn't functioning
anymore.


Programs that make up this package
==================================

There are two sets of programs -- those for work and those for home. The
filenames and number of programs are symmetrical. In the file listings below,
I've listed the HOME versions first, and the WORK versions second. The home PC
only needs the home versions. The WORK PC only needs the WORK versions.

If you have a Laptop, the HOME PC files will connect to the work machine, but
not the home machine. The WORK PC files will connect to your home machine but
not the work machine. Put the client files for both home and work on the
laptop. Don't bother with the server files.

Many files contain Rexx variables at the start which have to be assigned the
values appropriate for your situation. The files which have to be configured
are noted below. I suggest you start with all the files in one directory and
do the configuration. Then copy the configured files to their destinations.

HOME PC destinations: All CMD and EXE files can go in \TCPIP\BIN
		      Files required: HOMESERV.CMD (home server + daemons)
				      HOME2WRK.CMD (dial work)
				      AUTONETH.CMD (dial work, auto jobs)
				      HOMESRVD.CMD
				      HOMESRV.CMD
				      HOMECLI.CMD
		      Optional files (start various daemons)
				      STAFTPD.CMD  (starts FTP daemon)
				      STAGOSRV.CMD (starts GoServ)
		      The two *.CFG files go in \TCPIP\ETC
		      Files required: HOMESRV.CFG
				      HOMECLI.CFG

WORK PC destinations: All CMD and EXE files can go in \TCPIP\BIN
		      Files required: WORKSERV.CMD (work server)
				      WORK2HOM.CMD (dial home)
				      AUTONETW.CMD (dial home, auto jobs)
				      WORKSRVD.CMD
				      WORKSRV.CMD
				      WORKCLI.CMD
		      The two *.CFG files go in \TCPIP\ETC
		      Files required: WORKSRV.CFG
				      WORKCLI.CFG

Laptop PC destinations: All CMD and EE files can go in \TCPIP\BIN
		      Files required: WORK2HOM.CMD (to dial home)
				      WORKCLI.CMD
				      HOME2WRK.CMD (to dial work)
				      HOMECLI.CMD
		      The two *.CFG files go in \TCPIP\ETC
		      Files required: HOMECLI.CFG
				      WORKCLI.CFG


Both the home and work PC's need the following in \TCPIP\BIN or somewhere
else on the path:
				      MODE115.CMD or MODE576.CMD (set speed)
				      SC.CMD			 (set color)
				      COLOR.EXE
