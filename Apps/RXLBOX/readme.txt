   Description

   RXLBOX is a textmode menu program for OS/2 written in REXX.

   RXLBOX needs no further DLLs - even REXXUTIL is not needed.
   RXLBOX uses only ANSI sequences and ASCII codes to implement
   the menu.

   RXLBOX uses the cursor keys, function keys and a command 
   line for navigating through the menus. Nested menus are
   also supported. RXLBOX also supports menus for user input.

   RXLBOX is completly configurable using a menu description file       
   (including menus, messages, online help screens, function keys       
   and macros). 

   RXLBOX also supports an external message handling routine for
   language dependent usage.

   RXLBOX uses REXX as macro language in the menu description file.

   RXLBOX uses the EXTPROC feature of the CMD.EXE. Using this feature
   you can simply call your menu files from within a OS/2 session.

   See the file RXLBOX.MEN for a complete description of the
   menu description file; see the header of the file RXLBOX.CMD
   for an usage description.
