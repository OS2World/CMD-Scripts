 TEDIT vs EDIT

 Note: The purpose of this document is to compare the supported
       functions in TEDIT and EDIT.

 "+" denotes that TEDIT and EDIT support the function
     exactly alike.  If you find this to not be the case
     then report a bug.

 "-" denotes that EDIT does not support the function 
     and no support is planned.  

 "*" denotes that EDIT supports the function
     but not like TEDIT.  

 "?" denotes that I'd like your opinion on this issue.

I think it would be good to add a F key 
that would display a char set.  Opinion?
