BC - Background Carousel v1.00 (C) 1995 Tony Bearman

This program will change your desktop background randomly from a collection
of bitmaps in a directory that you specify.

If the program is invoked with no options, it will check to see if its
configuration has been set. If this is the first time it is run, or the
configuration is invalid, it will prompt for the missing items.

The configuration items that you can select are:

   Bitmap display   - scaled, normal or tiled
   Bitmap location  - a valid path containing OS/2 .BMP files
   Background delay - the number of seconds that you want between changes
                    - this item may be set to "Random", in which case you may
                      select a range for the randomizer

Command line options may be viewed by typing "BC /?".

The program was written in REXX, and compiled using REXXCC (c) by Bernd 
Schemmer. You must have installed REXX, with the RexxUtil.Dll in your libpath,
for it to work. If it fails to execute, you probably have damaged the Extended
Attributes of the program, and need to unarchive a fresh copy. If you still 
have trouble with it, make sure you are using LH v2.22, type "lh l -v bc", and
compare the CRCs for the following files:

Original  Packed    Rat Date     Time     Attr   Type  CRC   Name
--------  --------  --- -------  -------- ------ ----  ---   ------------------
    8023      3139  40% 95-10-08 14:43:24 ...... -lh5- DFEA +BC.CMD
    1947       483  25% 95-10-08 14:40:24 ...... -lh5- 3959  BC.CMD

...if your files differ, obtain a fresh archive. Make sure you do not use the
"/i" option when decompressing.  :-)

The program should work with screen savers. It should even work with other
background changers, although I don't think that makes much sense.

Background Carousel has been tested on a variety of machines, and makes no 
exotic calls, so it should be safe for your equipment and data. However, it
carries no guarantees other than occupying disk space. It is supplied "as-is"
and at no charge for personal use, but I reserve all rights.

Enjoy.
