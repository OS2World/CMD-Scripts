Encoding notes:
  writes 3-line MIME-compliant header
Decoding notes:
  auto-detects encoded data position
    in file (should have at 3 lines of
    encoded data to detect correctly)
  if outfile not given, guesses
    filename to decode, or writes to
    b64out.$$?. Does not overwrite
    out-files, never.
