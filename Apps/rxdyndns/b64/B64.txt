/*************************************************************************
* DOCUMENTATION for B64.CMD
*
* Intelligent Base64 encoder/decoder.
* Requires BASE64 API from MD5RX.DLL
*
* Created by Teet Kõnnussaar (teet@aetec.estnet.ee)
*
* This program is *freeware*, which means that you don't have to pay
* for it and you may use/modify it whatever way you want.
* But: This program is distributed AS IS, and with NO warranties,
*   neither implied or expressed.
*
* Usage:
*    B64 ( e | d ) [infile [outfile]]
*        e - for encoding (file -> base64)
*        d - for decoding (mail -> file)
*
* Encoding notes:
*     writes 3-line MIME-compliant header
*     if in-file not specified, reads standard input for data to encode
*     if outfile not specified, writes to standard output
*
* Decoding notes:
*     if in-file not specified, reads from standard input
*     auto-detects encoded data postition in file (should have at 
*        least 3 lines of encoded data to detect correctly)
*     if outfile not given, guesses filename to decode or writes to
*        b64out.$$?. Does not overwrite out-files, never.
*
