<Pre><Code>/* Data for ParamBSpline2, a REXX program by Doug Rickman, GHCC/MSFC/NASA

 /* Example input file.
 /* Compute a least squares bspline using 7 internal knots over the range
 /*    given by the variable MyU.  Output points are specified.  Note that
 /*    several of the requested ouput points are outside the input range and
 /*    are therefore dropped from the evaluation.

 /* Anything after the first &quot;/*&quot; on a line is ignored.
 /* Thus a line starting with &quot;/* is a comment.
 /* There is no variable typing, i.e. 1 = 1.0 = 1e+0

 /* Blank lines are ignored.

              /* enter &quot;height width depth w&quot;.  There must be one column in the
