 FITPACK is a collection of FORTRAN programs for CURVE and SURFACE FITTING with
 SPLINES and TENSOR PRODUCT SPLINES.

 Features included are automatic knot selection, error smoothing and data
 reduction. Besides the set of data points, the user merely has to provide a
 single parameter, called the smoothing factor, to control the tradeoff between
 closeness of fit and smoothness of fit. Confidence limits for this parameter
 are available if the statistical errors on the data can be estimated.

 In addition to a standard routine for curve fitting over an interval and a
 routine for fitting a bivariate spline function to a set of scattered data on a
 rectangular domain, there are special programs for smoothing periodic functions,
 parametric curves and surfaces, functions with convexity constraints. data over
 the sphere and other non-rectangular approximation domains. Very efficient
 surface fitting routines are provided for applications with data given either
 on a rectangular, polar or spherical grid. Routines are included for evaluation,
 differentiation and integration of the spline approximations. FITPACK also
 contains an insertion algorithm and routines for calculating zeros and Fourier
 coefficients of cubic splines.

 The subdirectory ex contains a test program for each of the 29
 main routines, e.g. the file mncurf.f contains a sample program for curfit,
 mnperc.f a test program for percur.f, etc. Some of the test programs need some
 input data. These can be found in the files with initials da, e.g. the program
 in mnpasu.f needs the data which are stored in dapasu, etc.

 The user-level routines should be fairly well documented. Besides a parameter
 description, there is a pointer to the lower level FITPACK routines, needed by
 this particular routine. This may be useful in case only a restricted number
 of fitting routines would be needed. A user guide of approximately 300 pages
 can be ordered by sending a check of 25 US dollars to

 The mathematical fundamentals of FITPACK are described in the book:
    Curve and Surface Fitting with Splines, by P. Dierckx,
    Monographs on Numerical Analysis, Oxford University Press, 1993,
    (ISBN 0-19-853441-8, 286 pages, 56 line figures)
 In addition, potential FITPACK users will find there a lot of practical advice,
 illustrated with many examples, both purely academic as well as taken from
 real live. Comments on the software or the book may be addressed to the author

 Finally, it should be noted that this software has no connection with
 the FITPACK software package of Alan Cline.
