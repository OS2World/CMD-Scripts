   <Strong>Why REXX?</Strong>
</H2>
I have used the REXX language for this implementation for several reasons.
<Ul Type=Disc>
   <Li>
      The language has an ANSI standard and wont be going away any time soon.
   <Li>
      It is more than fast enough for single data set applications.
   <Li>
      It is completely OS independent. All you need is a REXX interpreter. These are freely available for all operating systems, including super computers. I include pointers to common, popular interpreters below.
   <Li>
      The user can readily study and modify the code. It is one of the easiest languages to simply read. You can even watch variables being assigned as the code runs if you insert the instruction &quot;TRACE ?I&quot;. No need to recompile, link or anything else. Just run the program.
   <Li>
      It runs from the command line, i.e. telnet. This means I don't have to get to a special location to do my work.
   <Li>
      I don't have to worry about environment variables, paths, etc., etc.
