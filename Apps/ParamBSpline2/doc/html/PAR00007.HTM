<P Align=Left>Once the bsplines are generated for your data they are evaluated at predetermined points along the &quot;u&quot; axis. The result of each evaluation is an estimate of your data at that location. ParamBSpline2 gives you several ways to determine the output points. Interpolate will reproduce
the input locations and insert &quot;n&quot; points in between. &quot;n&quot;, the number of points to insert must be &gt;= 0. Resample will use the locations of the first and last points and then insert &quot;n&quot; points in between. This can be used to reduce the number of sample points. Fixed will
provide points at integer multiples of the &quot;n&quot; within the range of the first and last points. For example if n=0.25 and the first point is at 0.45 points will be created at5075 1.00 1.25.. The first and last points are also provided in the output. Specified will use the points you provide.
You may have as many as you wish. They must fit on a single line, but since there is no maximum imposed on the length of a line you can have quite a few. If you request evaluation at points that are outside of the data range those points will be ignored. DoLoop will provide points beginning at some
starting value, &quot;m&quot; and go to a stop value, &quot;n&quot;, in steps of &quot;p&quot;. For those who program this is simply a do loop. There is no check on the requested values versus the input data range. Thus you may request data outside of your data. Be very careful if you do this. GIGO!

<P Align=Left>The output of ParamBSpline2 is written to a file. The name of that file is set using OutputFile. Remember, if the file exists it will be appended without requesting additional permission. If it can not be written to ParamBSpline does not warn the user.
