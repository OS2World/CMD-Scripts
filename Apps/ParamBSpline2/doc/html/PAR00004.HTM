   <Strong>The Input File</Strong>
</H2>
<P Align=Left>Control and data are provided to ParamBspline2 via a file. An example of a complete input file is given in the section <A Target="TextContent" Href="PAR00009.HTM">Example Input Files </A>. To make a new input file the easiest thing to do is copy an existing example and modify it to meet
your needs.
<P Align=Left>The input file is an ASCII file, i.e. any text editor or word processor can read and write it. If you use a word processor be very sure to save the file in a plain ASCII format!
<P Align=Left>ParamBSpline2 reads this file in a two step process. In the first step everything is read into memory, one line at a time. Comments and blank lines are then discarded. Thus, you may add as many comments and blank lines as you wish, where ever you wish. A comment is anything after the first
&quot;/*&quot; character pair found on a line.
<P Align=Left>Next the program searches for certain control phrases. These phrases determine such things as the names of variables, the behavior of the spline fitting and the output. The various controls are given in logical groups. After the control phrase,&quot;Data = &quot;, the program digests the
input data table. Each control phrases and the data table are explained in subsequent sections.
