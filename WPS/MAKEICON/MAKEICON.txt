Hi !

This is a Preview of an Add-On Script for OS/2 Warp.
It exchanges most standard icons to extra elegant Hi-Res Hi-Color icons.

Just run MAKEICON.cmd, but be warned: Backup the contents of your WPS, because
 returning you to original state is only possible by restoring it, reinstalling
 or setting the original icons manually.

Feedback appreciated.
