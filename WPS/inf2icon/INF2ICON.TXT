INF2ICON - Makes WPS icons for INF files

INF files are OS/2 online help files.  They are viewed with the
VIEW.EXE utility, which comes with OS/2.

INF2ICON is used to make an icon on the desktop for an INF file.
It is a command-line utility.

Usage:
INF2ICON inf_file [folder_name]

inf_file is the name of the INF file for which you want an icon
folder_name is the a folder on the desktop where you want the ICONS to go

If folder_name is not specified, then the default name of "Online Help"
is used.  The folder is always created on the desktop, unless it already
exists somewhere else.

INF2ICON scans the INF itself for the descriptive name.  This is the
name that appears in the title bar when you view the help file.  This
same name is used as the name of the icon.  In this manner, you get
description icon titles instead of cryptic ones.

To process all the files in a directory, use something like:

        C:\OS2\BOOK> for %d in (*.inf) do inf2icon %d OS/2 Warp Online Information
