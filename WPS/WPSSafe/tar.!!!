    Hi!

    Please note that this package does NOT contain the full GTAK -- only
    the ReadMe text in 'tar.txt' and the executable 'tar.exe'.

    The full GTAK (currently in version 2.12b) is obtainable from most
    OS/2 archives.  I sincerely suggest you get it as it is usable for
    so many different purposes.

    GTAK is Gnu Tar which is OS/2-enhanced by Andreas Kaiser.


    Regards,
