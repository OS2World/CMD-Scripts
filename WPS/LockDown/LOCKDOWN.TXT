       Short Description:  LOCKDOWN V1.03 REXX package to lockdown wps by objectid.
        Long Description:  LOCKDOWN.CMD is a simple REXX script to change folders and icons 
                           with known objectid's to prevent deleting, copying, moving, renaming, 
                           shadowing or changing of their settings.  This would be particularly
                           useful for the LAN administrator who has users who are prone to
                           over-customization of their desktop beyond their skill and ability
                           to know what they are doing.
