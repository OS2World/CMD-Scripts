   LOCKDOWN.CMD is a simple REXX script to change folders and icons 
with known objectid's to prevent deleting, copying, moving, renaming, 
shadowing or changing of their settings.  This would be particularly
useful for the LAN administrator who has users who are prone to
over-customization of their desktop beyond their skill and ability
to know what they are doing.

   The script will alter ALL objectid's listed in the companion file,
LOCKDOWN.DAT.  Edit the file accordnig to your needs, leaving only one
objectid per line.  (A file LOCKDOWN.BAK has been provided that 
contains some 300 known object id's, for OS/2 and other common OS/2 
applications.  Also included is a REXX program, LISTIDS.CMD by
Bernd Schemmer, author of REXX Tips & Tricks, that will list all
objectids on a system.)

   When the variable 'switch' is set to "YES", settings for NODELETE, 
NOCOPY, NOMOVE, NORENAME, NOSETTINGS, NOSHADOW will be set to YES, 
which will remove the options for DELETE, COPY, MOVE, RENAME, SETTING 
and SHADOW, respectively, from the icon's popup window. 

   Changing the variable 'switch' to "NO" will do just the opposite, 
returning these options to icons from which they are missing.  At
this point, LOCKDOWN.CMD does NOT do a lot of error checking and
expects a reasonably knowledgeable user.

   To test LOCKDOWN.CMD, run LOCKTEST.CMD to create a folder on the
desktop called "LOCKDOWN.CMD Test Folder".  Notice that the popup
menu for this folder allows all of the aforementioned actions to be
performed upon it.  Then, make sure <WP_LOCKDOWN> is the only entry
in LOCKDOWN.DAT and run LOCKDOWN.CMD (with switch set to "YES").
Notice now that the folder can no longer be deleted, copied, moved,
renamed or shadowed, nor can its settings be opened.  (You may also
note that dragging the icon to copy or delete via the shredder, etc.
also no longer works.)  Setting switch to "NO" and running
LOCKDOWN.CMD again will allow you to delete that pesky icon.
