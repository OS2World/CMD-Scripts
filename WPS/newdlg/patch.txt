NEWDLG v1.1a (update)
---------------------

This is an update to the newdlg11.zip package, and replaces the PATCH.CMD
with a new, better working version...

The previous script didn't work with CMD.EXE (I use 4OS2, and it worked
with that one, so I assume it worked with any shell... but no..)

The reason why it didn't work is that CMD.EXE couldn't use environment
variables as %variable  but reqired %variable%  (an % in the end too).

There were also another error, but i don't think it did too much, really..
(As the matter fact, the thing that one made wrong, wasn't needed at all...)

Just replace the PATCH.CMD with the one supplied in this zip...
