If you're like me, you sometimes "miss" an icon when you double click.
If you're a lot like me, you probably have cursed a time or two at the
new LaunchPad in Warp when it popped up to say, "You missed the
icon, you dolt!"

Well, now you can have a LaunchPad that works just like the original,
but won't pop up each time you double click MB1 on the Desktop (or
on other open space).

New-lnch will remove the original LaunchPad and replace it with one
which can be placed anywhere in a folder or on the Desktop, but will
only pop up when you deliberately double click on it.

Use the command line arguments 'e', 'm', or 'r' to either eliminate the
LaunchPad altogether, install a modified version (as described in the
previous paragraph), or restore the original LaunchPad that was on
your system immediately after you first installed Warp.

You will have to remove "LAUNCHPAD" from the "AUTOSTART" line
in your config.sys file if you want to have no LaunchPad, or the
modified version only. If you do not remove it, OS/2 will recreate the
original LaunchPad when you reboot, and ADD IT to the modified version,
if you created a modified version.

You may install and run this program on as many machines as you want.
You can distribute it freely, however, I request that you include this text
file with the REXX program in any distribution. You may not charge a fee
from anyone for the use of this program

If this program trashes/ruins/destroys your system, your data, or your
salsa, I will not be responsible. You use it at your own risk. I don't think
it will, but that's my humble opinion, and is explicitly not a guarantee.
