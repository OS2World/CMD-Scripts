------ DOCUMENTATION OF MakeDoc v.1.0 by XmbSoft (CIS ID 100031,2136) ------



With MakeDoc, the creation of Book objects (hipertext documentation)
from an .INF file is easy. Once MakeDoc has been installed, drag
the icon of the *.INF file that contains the documentation of the
new program onto the MakeDoc v.1.0 Object Program: MakeDoc will 
automatically create the Book object. So, no need to use the Program 
template.


* Contents of MAKDOC.Zip *

* Installing MakeDoc *

Doble-click onto the Install.CMD icon. The program will ask you to 
pick one of the following options:

   1 - Create the Book object in the Desktop.                    [/D]
   2 - Create the Book object in the folder of the *.INF file.   [/F]
   3 - Create the Book object in the Information folder of OS/2. [/I]

I recommend to pick option 1. If you're used to intall all the Docs of 
your programs in the Information folder, pick 3. Depending on your 
selection, the Install program will create an object program with the
parameter /D, /F or /I. You can change later your selection: just open 
the Values window of MakeDoc v.1.0 object program and change what it is
typed in the Paramaters field (the program will display an error message
if the Parameters field is void or fill with an option different than 
/D, /F or /I).

Of course, choosing 1 does NOT mean that the Book object will be place 
permamently in the Desktop. You can move it wherever you want once it is
created.

The Install program will ask you then to type the drive and full path of
the directory where you want to install MakeDoc. If the directory does not
exist, it will be created.

The Install program will create three objects in your Desktop:

   1 - The MakeDoc v.1.0 by XmbSoft Program Object
   2 - The MakeDoc.DOC Shadow Object (documentation)
   3 - The REXX.INF Shadow Object (*.INF to use as example)

If you doble-click onto the MakeDoc.DOC shadow, you will view this 
documentation. If you drag the REXX.INF shadow onto the MakeDoc program
icon, an Object Book will be created (double-click the Object Book and
you will get the hipertext documentation of Rexx).

After installing and trying you can send to the Shreder the REXX.INF 
shadow (the original file will remain in your disk) and place the MakeDoc
program object and the MakeDoc.DOC shadow wherever you want (for example, 
in a Tools folder).


* Name of the Object Book *

If NAME.INF is the filename of the *.INF archive, the name of the new 
Object Book will be 'NAME Guide' (NAME will be written in uppercase).


* Checking your file is a real INFormation file *

MakeDoc will process the file especified only if:

   1 - the name of the file contents the substring ".INF";
   2 - the first five character of the file are "HSP›".

The second condition is controlled by the variables CompStr and CompNum
at the beginning of MakeDoc.CMD.


* Command Line Execution *

You can execute MakeDoc from an OS/2 Command Line Session. From the 
directory where MakeDoc is installed or elsewhere if that directory is
included in the PATH variable, type:

   MAKEDOC /X FULLPATH_FILENAME

where /X can be:
   /D   Place Book Object in the Desktop
   /I   Place Book Object in the Information folder
   /F   Place Book Object in the folder of the INF file

For example,

   MAKEDOC /D C:\OS2\BOOK\CMDREF.INF

will create the Command Reference Book in your Desktop.


* Errors *

If a Book Object is not immediatley created, an error has ocurred. Open 
the Task List Window (pressing at the same time both buttons of your mouse)
and select MakeDoc. An OS/2 Window session will be open and the error will 
be reported. Two kind of errors are supported:

   A - Syntax error.
       A Help message is displayed. This error occurs when no file is 
       provided or an incorrect option has been typed in the parameters
       field. If you doble-click onto MakeDoc v.1.0 instead of dragging 
       a file, you'll get this error.

   B - Bad file format.
       If you drag a file that is not a true INF file, the OS/2 Window
       Session will report that the file is not a Documentation file.
