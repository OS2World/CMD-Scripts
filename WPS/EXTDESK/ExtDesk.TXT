ExtDesk.CMD tries to call EXTINST.EXE or EXTREMOV.EXE depending on the class
"ExtendedDesktop" already being loaded (EXTREMOV), or not (EXTINST).

If you want to have Extended Desktop on your desktop, this allows you to use
one (ExtDesk.CMD) program object instead of two (both EXTINST and EXTREMOV).
There's really no need to remove Extended Desktop, but in an ideal world I'm
using its icon arranging capabilities just once or twice. ExtDesk.CMD has no
use if you're using Extended Desktop and you always want Extended Desktop to
be ready-to-use without a reboot.

To install: save ExtDesk.CMD anywhere if EXTINST.EXE and EXTREMOV.EXE can be
found in your PATH, or save ExtDesk.CMD in the same directory as the *.EXEs.

ExtDesk assumes all needed files can be found. It doesn't perform any checks
nor does it ask if you're sure (just like the underlying *.EXEs). The output
regarding reboots may be wrong if ExtDesk.CMD is executed more than once and
the systeem isn't rebooted since. ExtDesk.CMD itself doesn't cause a reboot.

I've added - and removed - a PM version with a question, because that looked
bad due to a few "undocumented features" of OS/2's PMRexx v2.0. A PM version
is the first thing to add back again, as soon as those bugs are fixed.

Remove the line with "PULL ." if you want to run ExtDesk.CMD minimized.
