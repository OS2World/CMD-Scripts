================================================
19/Oct/2005 - Yuri Dario <mc6530@mclink.it>

This code is released under the GPL license, see COPYING for details.
This software is provided AS IS, use it at your own risk.


System requirements:
--------------------
- eComStation 1.0,1.1,1.2.
- OS/2 Warp.
- file system with long file name support.
- recent kernels if you have older wptools.dll in your LIBPATH.


WPSDump
-------
Use this rexx script to make a backup of your desktop or part of your desktop.
A file named backup.log is used to save backup progress and errors.


WPSRestore
----------
This rexx script should have been copied to your dump directory. Run from there.
A file named restore.log is saved in current folder: it will record restore
progress and possible errors.
For example, shadows are likely to be skipped if the real object is still not
present (forward reference); the same happens for objects of unregistered classes.
Objects with empty titles will be replaced with ?.
If you are about to restore a full desktop, check first lines in folder.obj:
these are references to folder desktop, check setup string carefully for possible
differences, or remove all the record if the desktop is already existing (well,
I think it is not possible to restore the desktop folder, you need at least a
running WPS to execute this script).


Known bugs
----------
- does not register classes
- I suspect it will fail to restore some kind of object classes or with
  incomplete setup data.
- shadows not always created.


Support
-------
Since this is a OpenSource freeware product there are no
formal support options available.


Donations
---------
Since this software is developed for free, donations are welcome! you can use PayPal
to donate me and support OS/2 developement. See my homepage for details, or ask :-)
At least, a post card is welcome!
