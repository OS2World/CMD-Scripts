biff.cmd

This code will monitor pmmail inboxes for unread mail and keep a 
xcentre REXX Gauge widget updated.

Installation

1) Edit the SysFileTree line in biff.cmd to point to your PMMail directory.

2) Edit the SysOpenObject line in biff2.cmd to point to your PMMail directory.

3) RMB on you xcentre and select 'add widget' then select 'rexx gauge'  

4) Open the gauges properties

5) Cut 'n paste the entire biff.cmd code into the box labeled 'gauge script'

6) Cut 'n paste the entire biff2.cmd code into the box labeled 'double click action'

7) change the refresh rate to something reasonable. I use 60000 = one minute

8) Check OK

Thats it. 
The gauge will either show:

Green if there are no unread messages 
Yellow and the total of unread messages in all inboxes.
Red and the total of unread messages in all inboxes at least one iof which is urgent.

Double clicking the gauge will open pmmail.
