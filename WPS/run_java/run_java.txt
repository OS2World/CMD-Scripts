These scripts are designed to make working with IBM's
java13 and Innokek's Java14 a bit easier.  (I'll try to
add Golden Code's release when it is available)...

This is a generic script for starting java13 and 
java14 apps in OS/2-eCS.  (there are two separate
scripts:  java_13 first checks for java131, then it
looks for java13, java_14 first looks for the java14
runtime then it looks for the java_14 SDK)

[quick version... unzip this archive into a directory
   e.g. unzip run_java__20030225.zip -d run_java
 Run install_os2.cmd -- this will create a "Create Java
 Object" program object on your desktop.  Just drop a
 jar file on the object to create a program object for
 the .jar file. It will also create a "Run Jars" object
 -- this will allow you to start most modern java apps
 by just double clicking on the jar file.]


Long version:
You can just run java_1x.cmd without any aguments to get the general
structure of the parameters that it will accept.

Just place all of the files in this zip file in a directory.
Run "install_os2.cmd" to create a program object on your
desktop.  Now, if you drop a .jar file on this program object
it will create a new program object that will run the .jar
file.  It initially assigns a generic icon to the new program
object but you can change it to whatever you want.
Some java apps require some options in additon to the .jar file --
just add these options after the .jar file entry in in the
"Parameters" field of the new program object.
Alternatively, you can also just start most modern java apps
by just double clicking on the .jar file -- the "Run Jars"
object handles this.
All you need to do is create a shadow of your .jar file and
use it to start your app from your desktop or folder.
   Good examples of programs that will work with double clicking
   the .jar file:

e.g.
A java program located in c:\tcpip\spambot
The directions for spambot state that one only
needs to pass spambot.jar to the java program.
Then just open up the spambot directory (folder) and
drop "spambot.jar" onto the "Create Java Object"
This will create a new program object called "spambot"
with an object id of "jv13_spambot"

Double clicking on the program object should get
you up-n-running.

Now, perhaps spambot has a "-v" option.
Just put "-v" (without the quotes)
into the "Parameters" field after the spambot.jar
 e.g.
 Parameters:
   c:\tcpip\spambot\spambot.jar -v

or, perhaps it requires a "start" command or
has a "help" option... just enter the appropriate
"jarfile option" in the "Parameters" field e.g.
Parameters
...path...\spambot.jar -v start
 or
...path...\spambot.jar help

The latest version allows you to add options for java.exe...
  e.g. perhaps spambot.jar requires a large initial heap
    then the "Parameters" can be editted to add a 
    -Xms80M flag to set the initial heap to 80 MB
      e.g. 
          Parameters
	     -Xms80M -jar c:\tcpip\spambot\spambot.jar -v
