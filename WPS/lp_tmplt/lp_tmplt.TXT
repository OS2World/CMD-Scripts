Enclosed is a REXX script to create a LaunchPad Template from which
you can then use drag-and-drop to create new LaunchPads at will.
You only have to run the script once, and it will create a template
in your template folder, or on your Desktop if you don't have a template
folder.  The script is very simple, but everyone keeps asking how to
do this, so I decided to write one and upload it.

For this script to work, you must have REXX support installed.  You can
install REXX support with Selective Install.

Simple as it is, please do not distribute this program without
including this file (README) or the comment block in the REXX script.
