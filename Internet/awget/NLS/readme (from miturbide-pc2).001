Short description

    Auto WGet Daemon is a free utility set for driving GNU WGet or any 
    similar utility for downloading files. If you had been tired after you 
    found necessary link in Netscape Navigator, copy it to clipboard and 
    start WGet by hands (God! Are you so lazy? :), Auto WGet Daemon is that
    thing, you need. Auto WGet Daemon allows you to start downloading by 
    simply Drag'n'Drop to special folder. Aside from, Auto WGet Daemon 
    supports queue for downloads and allows restart failed downloads in
    the power fail or any other unpleasantness.

Download utilities
    
    At this time only two utilities are supported: GNU WGet and cURL.
    For a normal functionality Auto WGet Daemon you need to install either.
    Also you need make sure they are working. They must to be placed to any
    directory in PATH statement in CONFIG.SYS file.

    OS/2 version of GNU WGet you can find at Hobbes:
    http://http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/ (search "wget")

    cUrl for OS/2 you can find at support homesite:
    http://curl.haxx.se

Installation
  
    You need unpack archive file to any temporary folder and start INSTALL.CMD,
    to response to a couple of questions and all must be OK. Installation 
    program will create special folders named "ToDO" and "Auto WGet daemon" 
    at your Desktop. In addition, in %ETC% will be created (or updated, if 
    it isn't first installation) configuration file AWGET.CFG.

    Object for daemon starting will be placed to "Startup" folder. You don't 
    need restart computer after installation. Daemon will start immediately 
    after installation.

    For normal functional Auto WGet Daemon must be installed to any 
    long-name and extended attributes supported filesystem (HPFS, HPFS386, 
    JFS or FAT32).

Important notice

    This version of Auto WGet Daemon can be installed over previous version
    less than 1.6.1, but this isn't recommended strongly. If you are using
    version like this, you need de-install it, delete %ETC%\AWGET.CFG file
    and only after that install new one.

How it works
    
    Auto WGet daemon scans "ToDo" folder and sub-folder contents continuously.
    As soon as object with URL appears in those folders, download utility
    starts. At that object will be moved to Active folder. It is signal that
    download process had been started.

    In case of broken download or computer restarts all objects from Active
    folder will be moved to previous place and will be proceed in the regular
    manner.

How to feed necessary URL to daemon

    First method: when you see necessary URL, you can drag it by mouse to 
    "ToDo" folder (or subfolder). This URL will be placed to downloads queue.

    Second method: you need click right mouse button at the URL in the browser
    window and select "Copy Link Location". After that you need click right
    mouse button at "ToDo" folder icon or subfolder and select "Paste..."
    You can or can not enter other name for object. It doesn't matter. After 
    all you need press "Paste".    

    Third method: right click on the URL in the browser window and choose
    "Copy Link Location". After that, start "Add URL" from the 
    "Tools & Utilities" folder of Auto WGet Daemon, paste URL to the 
    edit-box if it doesn't appear there (by pressing SHIFT-INS or mouse 
    buttons simultaneously) and click on the "Add". By default object 
    with appropriate URL will be created in the "ToDo" folder, but you 
    can choose different sub-folder using combo-box over edit-box.

    Fourth method: you need prepare ASCII file with URL list (as sample NFTP 
    does this), execute "Add URL" and put to the edit box filename with list.
    In the "ToDo" folder will be created group of URLs objects from list.
    
    Fifth method: you need set USE_DESKTOP in configuration file to "1". 
    After this you will able to put URL by first and second method to 
    Desktop directly. Daemon will move it to "ToDo" folder.

    Sixth method: set CLIPBOARD_MONITOR key value in configuration file to 1
    and do everything the same as described in the third method with one
    exclusion only - add URL window will come up automatically after copying
    URL to clipboard is done.

Using in the network

    You can share "ToDo" and download folder and use server with installed 
    Auto WGet Daemon as common download center either as from OS/2 as from 
    Windows. In the case you have to drop URL in the folder.

    You can also establish client-server relations between two computers 
    working under OS/2 where Auto WGet Daemon is installed. Next example
    with two computers having NetBIOS names SERVER and CLIENT respectively 
    will show you how to do it.

    On SERVER you have to create subfolder with name at your will in "ToDo"
    folder. For an instance we call it "FromClient". Drag additional 
    configuration template file awget.cfg (located in "Tools & Utilities")
    into this folder and edit it. You have to uncomment and change values 
    for the following parameters:

       MESSAGE_DONE  = net send CLIENT "%M: %U"
       MESSAGE_ERROR = net send CLIENT "%M: %U"
   
    Additionally you have to assign to CLIENT reading and writing permissions 
    to the folder. In our case we share folder where Auto WGet Daemon is 
    installed.
    
    Now we create subfolder "ToServer" in "ToDo" folder on CLIENT and force
    download redirection for the folder in additional configuration file: 

       REDIRECT_TO = \\server\awget\folders\todo\fromclient
    
    That is it. Each URL dragged into "ToServer" folder on CLIENT will be 
    moved to "FromClient" folder on SERVER side and download completion 
    messages will be sent back to CLIENT by SERVER.

    Notice: creating special subfolder on CLIENT is not a must, you may
    just put awget.cfg into "ToDo" folder.

Some words about NFTP

    NFTP is well known FTP client for OS/2. It is being developed by Sergey
    Ayukov. It can be found at http://www.ayukov.com. To use Auto WGet 
    Daemon with NFTP it is enough to alternate two lines only in nftp.ini
    (don't forget to remove comment symbol ";" before them)

        launch-wget = "x:\path_to_awget\awgadd.cmd %s"
        enable-passworded-wget = yes

    Where "x:\path_to_awget" needs to be replaced to the directory where Auto
    WGet Daemon is located. Having this done you may issue download request
    to daemon highlighting desired files and pressing Shift-W.

Configuration

    Main configuration file (named "AWGET.CFG") is lying in the %ETC% 
    directory (usually point to \MPTN\ETC). There is an object in 
    the "Tools & Utilities" folder for editing configuration file. 
    Statement description is written in the configuration file body 
    as comments for each.  

    You can create subfolders in "ToDo" folder and put in their additional 
    configuration files. Use this future you can change some statements from
    main configuration file (folder processing time, download directory, etc.)
    A template for creating file like this can be found in "Tools & Utilities"
    folder.

    Don't forget erase comment begins symbol "#" before statement you want 
    to change.  

Known bugs
    
    - Auto WGet Daemon can't understand URL objects created by Netscape
      Communicator 4.61 in OS/2 Warp 3.0. You can use Netscape Navigator 2.02, 
      Netscape Communicator 4.04 or send the URL by "Add URL" object. Or
      you can use OS/2 Warp 4.0 and better :)
    - This software is incompatible with Vadim Yegorov aka VYX.

Additional programs

    Pmpopup2.exe Ulrich Sturmberg PM Popup Version 1.0

    Aside from, you need netstat utility from standard TCP/IP in 
    check for PPP connection case. 

Plugins

    Plugins are programs for improve and extend functionality of Auto 
    WGet Daemon. Two types of modules are supported - global and
    private. Global modules interact with daemon directly and are especially
    oriented to affect to job planning process. Private modules interact
    with each of started download processes and can affect at it 
    execution manner.
    
    To plug a module in you need add description to main configuration file 
    AWGET.CFG. Use the key GLOBAL_PLUGIN for global modules and PRIVATE_PLUGIN
    for private. A sample:

    GLOBAL_PLUGIN = Plugins\awpglob.cmd

    For activating a new global module you need restart daemon. Private 
    module will be plugged in as soon as particular download process will 
    be started. 

    Here is the info for the developers.

    Pluggable module is a detached process. It is running with daemon 
    (global modules) or with each particular download process (private 
    modules). You can interact with module through standard input/output
    streams. Communication accomplishes in string by string mode using
    special commands. Each string contains only one command. After posting
    string to module, answer must be received and daemon execution will be 
    stopped until answer appears. If configuration file contains more than
    one module, all modules will be served in order of definition.

    Command contains four symbol size keyword and optional information part.
    Between command and information part one space symbol must be inserted.

    Only two answers from information module are allowed: DONE and FAIL. DONE 
    denotes successful command execution. FAIL denotes existing of error or 
    execution restriction for the function asked. The information sent with 
    DONE, is printed to the screen. The information sent with FAIL is printed
    in the error log and to screen.

    Module can send one or more commands for additional info (INFO, EVNT 
    and ALRM) before sending DONE or FAIL. Info, following any of those 
    commands, will be printed at the screen. Also, info from EVNT command 
    will be recorded to event log and ALRM to error log.

    To interact with global modules next commands can be used:

      INIT awget_home_directory
      Will be sent in initialization time of Auto WGet Daemon. Module answer
      will be ignored.
      
      SCAN todo_directory
      Will be sent before scanning of Desktop and "ToDo" folder begins. In
      the case of FAIL answer at least of one module, scanning will be passed
      through.

      CONF configuration_file
      Will be sent after indicating of main configuration file changes. 
      Module answer will be ignored.

      SEXE job_file
      Will be sent before starting download process. Module can change job
      file content. In the case of FAIL answer, startup will postpone.

      SEND job_file
      Will be sent after download process completion.  Module can change
      job file content. Module answer will ignore.

      STOP 
      Will send before daemon's shutdown. Daemon won't wait for an answer
      from module. It will shutdown immediately after sending command to all 
      modules.

    To interact with private modules next commands can be used:

      INIT job_file
      Will be sent in the download initialization moment. Module can change
      job file content. In the case of FAIL answer at least of one module, 
      process will stop.

      DATA 
      Will be sent before download utility output translation begins. After 
      answer DONE, module must change input mode to symbol. Translation will
      end by '00'x.

      STOP job_file
      Will be sent before download process shutdown. Module can change 
      job file content. Module answer will ignore.

    Samples for global and private plugin can be found in the "Plugins" 
    directory of Auto WGet daemon.

Job file

    All the information required by the download process can be sent through
    job file. Job file format is like configuration file and contains 
    pairs - key and value. Next keys are used:

      OBJECT                Object with URL name, which will proceed.
      URL                   Download URL.
      DOWNLOAD              Folder, where file will placed after download.
      MESSAGE_DONE          Successful download command.	
      MESSAGE_ERROR         Broken download command.
      DOWNLOADS_UTILITY     Download utility.
      DOWNLOADS_PARAMETERS  Download utility parameters.
      DOWNLOADS_RC          Download utility exit code.
      DOWNLOADS_INFO        Download utility last message.

    Some samples for reading and writing job files can be found in 
    awpglob.cmd and awppriv.cmd files in "Plugins" directory.
