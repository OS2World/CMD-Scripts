Real Audio Setup for WebExplorer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These scripts are the easiest and cleanest way of setting up Real Audio 2.0.
Please follow all instructions, and replace displayed directories with your 
own.  Be sure to have DOS TCP/IP and Win-OS/2 sound card _correctly_ setup.

0. Install Real Audio 2.0 for Win 3.1 in Win-OS/2 ;-)

1. Run makeobj.cmd followed by the FULL path name to and including
   raplayer.exe.  Set Win-OS/2 settings like you want them and hide the
   object wherever you want, if won't matter at all.

   [G:\temp>] makeobj g:\raplayer\raplayer.exe

2. Be sure you have WebEx external files setup like this in explore.ini:

   [advanced]
   ; advanced user settings - edit with care!
   ;
   ; mailcap= specifies full path to user mailcap file
   ; format is:  mime/type; program_name params %s
   ; example:    image/jpeg; jview -r %s
   ; no wildcards allowed, no piping, no unix commands
   mailcap=g:\tcpip\etc\explore.cap
   ; extmap= specifies full path to user extension map file
   ; format is:  mime/type     extension_list
   ; example:    image/jpeg    jpg jpeg jpe
   extmap=g:\tcpip\etc\explore.ext

3. In the 'mailcap' file you have specified, add a line like this:

   audio/x-pn-realaudio; G:\RAPLAYER\raplay.cmd %s

4. In the 'extmap' file you have specified, add this exact line:

   audio/x-pn-realaudio   ra ram

5. Listen to Real Audio pages!!

Notes
~~~~~
Setup Real Audio Player object to run in Win-OS/2 enhanced mode to fix "out
of memory" errors.

Clicking on a Real Audio link while Real Audio Player object is opened will
only bring foreground the Real Audio Player.  When that happens, go "Open
File..." and choose the immediate "-random-.ram" or "-random-.ra" file you
see.
