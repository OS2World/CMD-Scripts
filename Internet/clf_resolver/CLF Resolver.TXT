 [ What?! ]

  CLF Resolver is a small REXX script I wrote for personal reasons, but which
  I believe others may make use of as well.

  What is does is scan a log file in Common Log Format (CLF) or Extended
  Common Log Format (ECLF), attempting to resolve unresolved IP addresses in
  the "remote host" section of each log entry. If successful, it the dotted IP
  address is replaced with the host name; if not, the line is left as is.

  The changed log file is output to a separate file; if the output file does
  already exist, it will be appended. This makes the script capable of
  collecting cycled log files into one large, resolved file; for instance for
  use with log analysers/statistics generating programs.

  Specifically, this tool was written to be used in conjunction with Xitami,
  but it will work with any other web server using CLF (e.g. Apache); indeed,
  with /any/ server conforming to the CLF or ECLF log format...


 [ Why?! ]

  Well, it all began with me realising that the Xitami web server (which I
  happen to love) is not capable of doing (and logging) reverse-DNS on access
  in the standard version (allegedly, the Pro version can).

  I should note that since doing reverse-DNS might take a bit of time, there
  can be sound performance reasons for /not/ enabling/logging reverse-DNS in
  high-impacted environments like that of a web server; particularly on small
  systems (and I run my www.subetha.dk on an outdated 486-DX-66 (with OS/2 of
  course) so that was another good reason for me to do this script)...

  As a result, statistics generators, like Webalizer, which can show various
  interesting information based on host names would not provide the statistics
  I needed.

  Well, that's all changed! :-)

  Now, in the Cron'ed statistics job, I simply use this script on the log file
  before feeding the changed version to Webalizer.


 [ How?! ]

  For each valid line in the source log file, my CLF Resolver pulls out the
  "remote host" field and tries to resolve it to a name using the native
  REXX socket API. I've seen similar solutions (hi Michael Reinsch .-) that
  did all sorts of tremendously tedious and overheadish work by spawning the
  external "HOST.EXE" program of OS/2, piping the output into the RXQUEUE and
  then parsing that. Geez... Where that might work it's not as neat and tidy
  a solution as this; and ofcourse - since we run OS/2 - we want it neat and
  tidy! :-) This script resolves hosts very fast compared to that solution,
  because it uses no external programs, merely the socket enabling REXX EWS
  extension DLL that has been bundled with OS/2 for quite some time now!

  Do note that since this program was never meant to be a "cycled log
  collector", it has no explicit features regarding this, apart from its
  ability to append the output. You will need to handle this yourself from
  another script, if you really have to. I don't have to; I use Webalizer as
  my log analyser, and it is capable of incremental log processing, i.e. it
  doesn't care how often the logs are cycled.


 [ Invokation ]

  Usage: "CLF Resolver.CMD" <Input LOG File> <Output LOG File> [NoProgressMark]

   Input and Output log files are mandatory. If the output log already exists,
   it is appended.

   During processing CLF Resolver will normally display a progress indicator
   along with the number of the current line # being processed. If you do not
   want this (it slows things down a little but, but not all that much) - for
   instance if it will always be run unattended in the background by a Cron
   schedule - you can disable the progress indicator by entering any 3rd
   argument on the command line.

   During its hard work to please you, CLF Resolver will output some minimal
   information about what it's doing. In particular, errors will, of course,
   be reported (along with an error level) if such occur. Warnings of un-
   resolvable addresses are also output; these are quiet and only meant as
   informational (i.e. the script continues to run without problems).


 [ Examples ]

  "CLF Resolver.CMD" before.log after.log

   ^^^ This will try to resolve dotted addresses to names in "before.log",
       saving the transformed log file as "after.log".
       Progress indicator will be visible...

  "CLF Resolver.CMD" Access.LOG Statistic.LOG NoProgress

   ^^^ This will try to resolve dotted addresses to names in "Access.LOG",
       saving the transformed log file as "Statistics.LOG"
       Progress indicator will /not/ be visible... It is not important what
       the 3rd argument contains; it may be anything, really...

  The above invokations could, as an example, transform the following lines ...

   194.192.158.236 - - [09/Apr/2000:14:51:10 +0002] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 1002 "" "MindCrawler v3.1 Indexer, support@mindpass.com"
   194.255.118.225 - - [09/Apr/2000:21:57:25 +0002] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1002 "" ""
   195.215.220.189 - - [11/Apr/2000:09:11:08 +0002] "GET /Frodo HTTP/1.1" 302 0 "" ""

  ... into the following lines ...

   cph-crwl1.mindpass.com - - [09/Apr/2000:14:51:10 +0002] "GET / HTTP/1.0" 200 1002 "" "MindCrawler v3.1 Indexer, support@mindpass.com"
   194.255.118.225 - - [09/Apr/2000:21:57:25 +0002] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 200 1002 "" ""
   ip189.abnxr6.ras.tele.dk - - [11/Apr/2000:09:11:08 +0002] "GET /Frodo HTTP/1.1" 302 0 "" ""

  Note that the second line has not changed. This is because CLF Resolver was
  unable to resolve the IP to a name.

 [ Conditions ]

  "Free CardWare!"

  Hmmm... If you can use this program, great! If not, I don't want to hear
  about it - just delete it.

  Also, I can make /no/ guarantees - implied nor explicit - that this script
  in an unlikely frenzy misbehaves on your system; if it does, I'm sorry, but
  that's all I can do about that.

  BUT IF you find CFG Resolver really useful (I define that as: continuing to
  use it after a month); /please/ do consider mailing me a local postcard with
  a quick comment. It's great to see that other OS/2 users exist, and to find
  out where they are situated.


 [ Final Words! ]

  Hos and hellos to the rest of Team OS/2 Aalborg, Denmark; my brother Mikkel;
  my girlfriend Signe - and every remaining faithful OS/2 user out there! :-)

  And please: Stop whining about OS/2 dying because there won't be a new
              client and all such rubbish. I don't use OS/2 because I wan't
              a new client every odd year - on the contrary, I revel in the
              fact that it is so thoroughly well designed a system that it
              can do perfectly well without being released in a "new" version
              every year (like another OS we all know and loathe) - or every
              month, like another, free, technically obsolete, OS we know...


 That's about it, I guess. See you around folks! :-)
