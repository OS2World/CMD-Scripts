                      HTML_TXT: An HTML to Text Converter                       
 
 I) Introduction  
 
HTML_TXT, version 1.09, is used to convert an ÙHTMLı file to a TEXT file. HTML_
TXT is written in REXX and is meant to be run under OS/2. However, it also runs 
under other REXX interpreters, such as Regina REXX for DOS. 
 
HTML_TXT will attempt to maintain the format of the ÙHTMLı document by using 
appropriate spacing and ASCII characters. HTML_TXT can use ASCII art Ù(lines and 
boxes)ı, as well as other high-ascii characters, to improve the appearance of 
the output (text) file. 
 
HTML_TXT can be customized in a number of ways. For example, you can:

   @ suppress the use of line art and other high ASCII characters (your output 
     will be rougher, but will suffer from fewer compatability problems). 
 
   @ display tables (including nested tables) in a tabular format with 
     auto-sized columns 
 
   @ change the bullet characters used in ordered lists
 
   @ display <HN> Ùheadingsı as an hierarchical outline
 
   @ change characters used to signify logical elements (emphasis, anchors, list 
     bullets, etc.) 
 
                     ______________________________________                     
 
 II) Installling and Executing HTML_TXT 
 
HTML_TXT is easy to install and run:

  1. Copy HTML_TXT.CMD to a directory.
 
  2. Open up an OS/2 prompt, change to the directory containing HTML_TXT.CMD, 
     and type HTML_TXT at the command prompt. 
 
  3. Follow the instructions.
 
ÙNo other libraries or support files are needed.ı
 
    The READ.ME file describes how to install HTML_TXT if you are a Regina 
    REXX user. 
 
 II.a)  Running from the command line  
 
You can also run HTML_TXT from the command line. The syntax is (where x:\HTMLTXT 
is the directory containing HTML_TXT.CMD): 
    x:\HTMLTXT>HTML_TXT FILE.HTM FILE.TXT /VAR VAR1=VAL1 ; VAR2=VAL2
where :

  #  FILE.HTM is the input file (an HTML document)
 
  #  FILE.TXT is the output file (a text document)
 
  #  /VAR VAR1=VAL1 ; VAR2=VAL2 is an OPTIONAL list of parameters to modify.
 
                                                                                 
ÙExample:     D:\HTMLTXT>HTML_TXT FOO.HTM FOO.TXT /VAR LINEART=0 ; LAGUL=* $     
                                                                                 
ALTERNATIVELY, you can run HTML_TXT from an (OS/2) prompt without any arguments; 
you will then be asked for an input and output file, and will be permitted to 
change the values of several of the more important parameters.

 III) Features  
 
HTML_TXT attempts to support many HTML options; including nested tables, nested 
lists, centering, and recognition of FORM elements.

HEADINGS   HTML_TXT supports two methods of displaying                          
           <Hn> headings (where n=1,2,..,7).                ÙPREH1 and POSTH1ı

             2. Headings can be used to create a            ÙPREHN and POSTHNı  
                hierarchical outline.                       specify the "quote"

           A hierarchical outline refers to headers that    for other <Hn>

 IV)  Changing Parameters  
 
As noted in the customization column of the above table, HTML_TXT contains a 
number of user configurable parameters. 
 
Although the default values of these parameters work well in most cases, you can 
change them by editing HTML_TXT.CMD with your favorite text editor Ù(look for 
the "user configurable parameters" section)ı 
 
Alternatively, you can temporarily changes values using the /VAR command line 
option. In fact, by specifying a PLIST=file.ext (in the /VAR section), you can 
create custom instructions for sets of HTML documents. 
 
The following lists the more important parameters. ÙOf particular interest are 
the NOANSI, LINEART, TABLEMAXNEST, TABLEMODE2 and TOOLONGWORD parameters.ı

 V) Troubleshooting HTML_TXT 
 
The following lists possible troubles you might have, and suggested solutions.

     … HTML_TXT display all kinds of wierd garbage (such as $ and [ characters)
 
         You don't have ANSI support installed. You should either install 
         ANSI.SYS (for example, include a DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\ANSI.SYS in your 
         OS/2 CONFIG.SYS file), or set NOANSI=1 (in HTML_TXT.CMD).. 
 
       Nested tables aren't displaying properly (this is especially likely to 
     happen when running under Regina REXX for DOS). 
 
         You can try using lists instead of tables -- set TABLEMAXNEST=0 (in 
         HTML_TXT.CMD). . 
 
     … Tables have unappealing characters used as vertical and horizontal lines
 
         Either your output device (say, your printer) does not support 
         high-ascii characters, or your code page is somewhat unusual. You can 
         use standard characters (- and !) for line borders by setting LINEART=0 
         (in HTML_TXT.CMD).. 
 
     Ã Unappealing characters are being used as bullets and to "quote" text 
     strings 
 
         This can also occur if your code page is somewhat unusual. You can 
         either change the various "display control parameters" (in HTML_
         TXT.CMD), or you can set LINEART=-1; in which case some default, 
         standard charactes (such as * and @ for bullets) will be used. . 
 
     Õ Long words (such as URLs) are being lost.
 
         You can change the "trimming" action to "word wrap", or to "extend 
         beyond margins", by setting the TOOLONGWORD parameter. 
 
     Œ The display of headings is not informative
 
         You can set HN_OUTLINE=2, heading will then be displayed in an "outline 
         format". You can even change the numbering style (say, 2.a.ii versus 
         II.2.b) by changing the HN_NUMBERS.n parameters.
