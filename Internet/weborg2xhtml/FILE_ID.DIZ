WebOrganizer-to-XHTML, first release

ONG Software's WebOrganizer was
developed when Netscape 2.02 was the
best available browser and with the
intent of using the created pages only
locally. With new standards for Web
documents and new browsers, and with
the desire to access bookmarks from any
location, this Rexx script has been
composed. It updates WebOrganizer's
pages to XHTML 1.0 + CSS. Package
includes a basic style sheet which
(mostly) emulates the stock
WebOrganizer pages' look and feel.
