This REXX script creates WEB Explorer URL objects from the quicklist that
is stored in the explore.ini file. It creates a folder on the desktop
called URL's" and populates it with all the quicklist entries.

Warning: This script only works with the beta v950525 version of the Web
Explorer or newer, as this feature does not exist on previous versions.
