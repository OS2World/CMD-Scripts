Mozilla Registry Tools v0.1.0
-----------------------------
This is a set of programs that will (hopefully) allow human beings, disassemble
to plain text format, easily edit and rebuild Netscape/Mozilla/SeaMonkey
registry.dat file(s).

RegDump.cmd makes a text dump of a registry file contents. Intended for
 'advanced' stuff.
Reg2txt.cmd dumps just the essential info of a registry file structure so it
 can be edited.
Txt2reg.cmd rebuilds a binary registry file from a text dump.

Each program should be otherwise self-explanatory, but if you have any
questions feel free to drop me a line to mrwarper@yahoo.es
