LaMtoMR2 - A program to convert LaMail nicknames, folders, and mail
           into the MR2Ice format.

LaMtoMR2 will migrate your existing LaMail nickname file into the
MR2Ice address book maintaing nicknames, real names, and addresses.
It will also migrate any distribution lists you may have in LaMail
to MR2Ice groups.  Existing LaMail folders, with or without mail
in them, will be created for MR2Ice.

The program will prompt you for the drive where you have installed
MR2Ice if you have more than 1 drive (or multiple partions).
Please enter a single letter when prompted without the semi-colon.

You will also be asked if you want to move your mail from LaMail
into MR2Ice or if you want your mail copied.  If you choose to
move your mail make SURE you have a BACKUP in case something
should go wrong.  If you decide to move your mail, LaMtoMR2 will
clean up the LaMail folder directory structure and remove the
LaMail index files if you want it to.

Before LaMtoMR2 does anything it will check and make sure that
the drive where you have installed MR2Ice has enough room to
hold all of the mail you have stored in LaMail.

This is a "one time" use program so there is no registration fee.

If you found it helpful and were pleased with the results I would
appreciate US 5 dollars for the effort and testing I put into it.

If you are so inclined please send 5 dollars to:
