You just found the most, perhaps, exciting REXX script in your life :-)
This program will help those of you who want to replace that pile of
.HTML, .GIF and other files in the, say, \JavaOS2\docs\ directory with
something easier to read, manage, search and so on, I mean the usual OS/2
.INF books. I personally don`t like to search needed information using GREP.
You too? Well, then this program is for just for you.

Since version 2.0 (and maybe even 1.2?) OS/2 have a so-called Information
Presentation Facility subsystem. Well, let`s face it - it is far from
perfection, especially counting that it has not been changed *at all*
since 1990 :-( On the other hand, it have a very neat feature: its small
and (relatively) fast. How much time loads your browser? Well, divide
this time by ten and you`ll obtain the time required to load VIEW.EXE.

The processing is fully automa(g)(t)ical. You just have to launch

 HTML2IPF <index.html>

and you`re done. Of course, like any well-behaved program HTML2IPF has a
number of switches, but usually you won`t need them.

The conversion process requires two stages. First (the most complex) is to
convert the bunch of HTML files into a single .IPF file, and all pictures
into the plain dumb .BMP format. Once you`re done, you just have to
run IPFC on this IPF file and you`ll get the final .INF file! (of course,
if no fatal errors will happen - and usualy they don`t).

To try it just now, go into the doc/ subdirectory and launch MAKEINF.CMD.
The documentation for the HTML2IPF is provided in HTML format, but you
can convert it into INF format and delete the pile of HTML and GIF files.
For this script to work properly, you`ll need the Image Alchemy for OS/2
to convert GIF files into OS/2 BMP. If you don`t have it - don`t worry, you
have many other ways to do it. If you`re running OS/2 v4.0 (Merlin) you can
pre-convert GIF files by right-clicking on them and selecting Convert to->
Bitmap->OS/2 v1.3 format (I REPEAT: v1.3 NOT THE 2.0 FORMAT!). If you
have Warp 3.0 you can use any suitable conversion tool (say PMView),
or even a DOS tool (aaaaargh! if you`ll do it, you`ll lose the nifty
character cases in names).
The second thing you`ll need for this process to complete, is the
Information Presentation Facility Compiler, i.e. IPFC.EXE. It is included
into OS/2 Developer`s Toolkit. Set up it properly (if you installed
the Toolkit, the installer already done it) - the only thing it requires
is a SET IPFC=#:\toolkit\ipfc environment variable. Now you can run
MAKEINF.CMD and see what`ll happen.
