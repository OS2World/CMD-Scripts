In the middle of Mar, 1997 I downloaded a handy OpenGL API reference from Digital corp.
WWW site. Alas, I hate documentation in HTML format since it takes too much time until
browser gets loaded, beside this each such documentation is a big set of HTML files,
which you should keep in a separate directory, otherwise you`re completely messed up.
I don`t like this since I have really lots (around 40 megabytes) of documentation on my
HD in the INF format, and everything fits in a single directory without worry. So I thought
of a way to make an 'regular' OS/2 INF book from a bunch of HTML and GIF files.
</P>
<P>
So I took a look inside all those HTML files (believe me or not, I didn`t know the HTML
language until that). Then I looked into OS/2 IPF (Information Presentation Facility)
reference and - oh God! - I've seen almost the same tags, except that IPF tags are written
using ':' in the beginning and '.' at the and, and HTML tags are written using '&lt;' and
'&gt;' respectively. (Seems that OS/2 IPF language is a slightly enhanced and modified
version of HTML 1.0, although maybe I`m wrong - it could be the Unix MAN format, I`m not
familiar with it).
</P>
<P>It took me about two weeks to complete the task (I have a job beside hobbies, you know
:-). I first wrote a 'first-version' in one night (it was really <B>SLOW</B>), then I
invented a neat way to parse HTML tags in REXX (if you`re interested - take a look at the
<A HREF="html2ipf_tech.html">tech info</A> section or even directly to the
<A HREF="../html2ipf.cmd">REXX script</A>), and then about a week I`ve added some
bells &amp; whistles (you know, they`re taking most of the time). And here
is it, the first version of HTML2IPF.
</P>
<P>
This REXX script will convert a set of .HTML files into one big .IPF file. The .IPF file 
can be used as a input to IBM's IPFC (Information Presentation Facility Compiler) to 
create regular OS/2 INF files. One more usage for this is that you can use any of lots 
of available today HTML editors to create OS/2 books.
</P>
<P>What's the pro and cons for doing this?</P>
<UL>
<LI>Pro: Basicaly .INF files are much smaller than .HTML files. Usualy an INF file generated 
from a set of .HTML files occupies half of space occupied by HTML files (a exception from the
rule are files with many GIF & JPEG pictures since IPFC picture compression is much worse
than that of GIF and JPG). Another gain is that you have a single .INF file which you can
easily manage.<BR>
Beside this, many software makers publishes complex HTML documents on their Web site, which
many of us want to have at hand. This is especially crucial to miscelaneous white papers
(say, the OpenGL reference manual -- the main cause why I started to write HTML2IPF), since
INF file are fully (and fast) searchable.
<LI>Con: You lose portability. INF format is not so widespread as HTML, so you basicaly
should convert documents for internal usage only (or documents which presents interest to
OS/2 (and maybe DOS) community only). Beside this, IPF tag language is much less flexible
than HTML, so complex documents (especially which makes heavy use of HTML 2.0 and 3.0 tags)
will be converted into a unusable book (although in most cases you can manually fix this
later, if the task is worth it).
