 [*] Modified
 [+] Added feature
 [-] Removed feature
 [!] Bug fix

<B>0.1.1
-----</B> 07-Apr-1997
 [!] Ooops! A bug introduced in last minutes caused a REXX fault
     when parsing stand-alone images (on separate pages).

<B>0.1.0
-----</B> 05-Apr-1997
 [+] Improved table handling
 [+] Now all &lt;A IMAGE=...&gt. tags located between &lt;A HREF=...&gt; tags
     are treated as real image links.
 [+] Added processing of &lt;CENTER&gt; tags, but still not too correct
     (text is treated as pre-formatted). If you don`t like it, you can
     disable it with -CENTER- switch.
 [;] Found lots of GIF files on which ALCHEMY does not work correctly :-(
     Particularily, there was lots of such GIFs in OpenGL 1.1 specs, borrowed
     from SGI site. As a workaround you can use the "Convert to:" feature of
     Warp4 which works pretty well, or maybe (I didn`t tried it) any other
     converter which can produce OS/2 v1.3 (uncompressed!) bitmaps.
     Those GIFs are monochrome with a transparent background which
     produces a really neat INF file.
 [+] Added some tags so that JDK 1.0.2 docs will compile without errors.
     Note that I had to fix a lot of real errors in those HTML files, so if
     you simply want the final INF file, I`ve uploaded it along with this
     version to <A HREF="http://hobbes.nmsu.edu">hobbes.nmsu.edu</A>.
 [+] Added the 'CHECK' switch so that HTML2IPF will not produce output file,
     but only will check the HTML structure (you can enable debug output -DEBUG+
     with this option to get a long paper with all encountered errors) and also
     you can see which links are missing. For example, mentioned above JDK 1.0.2 
     docs does not contain some files related to java.sun.tools.*
 [+] Added support for paths relative to the <I>document</I> path, not to the
     current directory.


<B>0.0.9
-----</B> 01-Apr-1997
 [;]  The first public release, nothing new :-)
