<BODY>
<P>This section covers some technical details on how HTML2IPF works, and how to make it work
when it does not :-)</P>
<P>If HTML2IPF makes an empty IPF file (or empty sections), this usually means that original
HTML file is a bit non-standard. To verify this, you can enable debugging:</P>
<P><TT>HTML2IPF -DEBUG+ index.html</TT></P>
<P>This normally will produce a log file HTML2IPF like this:</P>
<PRE>
--- [30 Mar 1997, 11:42pm] Conversion started: Index file index.html
--- Parsing file "index.html" ...
--- Parsing file "opengl_index_alpha.html" ...
--- Parsing file "glAccum.html" ...
--- Parsing file "glAlphaFunc.html" ...
--- Parsing file "glArrayElementEXT.html" ...
[...]
</PRE>
<P>If after a 'Parsing file "..."' you see a lot of 'unexpected tag' and 'unexpected text' messages,
this usually means that HTML2IPF's state machine gets out of synch with the HTML file sections, i.e. for
example, it encounters tags used in &lt;BODY&gt; section in &lt;HEADER&gt; section, plain text in the
&lt;HEADER&gt; section and so on. You should fix such files manually.
</P>
<P>If you get lots of 'Unexpected tag' message on certain tag, and this tag is crucial for
you, you can add your own handler for such tags into HTML2IPF. For this, you should do
two things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Find the ParseContents subroutine, and find the big SELECT...END block in it. This select
calls different routines depending of tag. Insert a handler for your tag here, like these:
<PRE>
when Tag = 'TITLE'	then TagBreakPos = doTagTITLE();
when Tag = '!TITLE'	then TagBreakPos = doTag!TITLE();
when Tag = 'META'	then TagBreakPos = doTagMETA();
when Tag = 'A'		then TagBreakPos = doTagA();
when Tag = '!A'		then TagBreakPos = doTag!A();
</PRE>
Note that HTML2IPF replaces the "/" character from tags with a "!" character, since "/" cannot be
a part of a subroutine name. So, the &lt;HTML&gt; tag becomes &lt;!HTML&gt;
<LI>Realize a 'tag handler' subroutine; all tag handlers have the 'doTag####' name where
#### is the name of your tag.
</UL>
<P>Tag handler gets called from the ParseContents subroutine (and can recursively call
ParseContents too, like the handlers for &lt;HEADER&gt; and &lt;BODY&gt; do), and can
use following variables to get information about its environment:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Token - contains the full text between &lt; and &gt; marks for current tag.
<LI>Tag - is the current tag (i.e. 'BODY', 'HEADER', 'B', 'A' etc).
</UL>
</P>
<P>Beside this, to parse tokens with multiple subtags
(like &lt;IMG SRC="a.gif" ALT="missing picture" ALIGN=center &gt;),
there is a procedure called ParseTag. It accepts as a parameter the initial token (i.e.
the contents of described above Token variable). All 'subtag' handlers should have the name in the
form: doTag[Prefix]_[Subtag] where Prefix is the 'main' HTML tag, i.e. the handler for
&lt;IMG SRC="..."&gt; subtag will have the doTagIMG_SRC name etc. Following variables are
usable in the context of such a handler:
<UL>
<LI>Prefix - contains the prefix of the subtag, i.e. 'A', 'IMG' or any other tag, the handler
for which calls ParseTag routine.
<LI>SubTagValue - contains the right side of the expression, i.e. for the IMG SRC="a.gif"
the SubTagValue variable will contain a.gif (quotes are automatically removed).
So, a simple &lt;IMG ...&gt; handler should look somewhat like this:
</P>
<PRE>
doTagIMG:
 call ParseTag Token;
[insert image into output text]
return 0;

doTagIMG_ALIGN:
 if Pos('&lt;'translate(SubTagValue)'&gt;', '&lt;LEFT&gt;&lt;RIGHT&gt;&lt;CENTER&gt;') > 0
  then Global._imgAlign = SubTagValue;
return 0;

doTagIMG_SRC:
 Global._imgName = SubTagValue;
return 0;

doTagIMG_ALT:
 Global._altName = SubTagValue;
return 0;
</PRE>
</UL>

<P>To output a text string into output text, you can use either PutToken or PutText
subroutines. The difference is that first is used to put control tokens (like :p. or :ehp4.)
while second is meant for plain text, and does conversion of control codes (i.e. if you`ll
call PutText(':ehp3.') in the output file you`ll got the "&col.ehp3&per." text, which is not
a valid IPF tag, but will be seen as the original :ehp3.' in the INF book). Also there is a NewLine
routine which does a NewLine in the output stream <B>if</B> current line is non-empty.
</P>
<P>One more detail: the Global. stem is used to keep all global variables, while any other
variable is usualy local to the procedure. Each procedure contains an
<PRE>
expose Global.;
</PRE>
operator, which makes every member of Global. stem visible everywhere.

<P>If you`ll make some useful changes, please send the changes <A HREF="apz.html">to me</A>,
so I will incorporate any valuable changes into the HTML2IPF in future versions.
