# PURPOSE OF THIS PROGRAM

The purpose of this program is to automatically compile directory
overviews into one or more HTML files which then can be viewed with a
browser.

It can be used to compile any directory overviews, but was primarily
written to get a more or less comfortable overview of the ever growing
number of HTML files which find their way on the local hard disk these
days.

When HTML files are found the program will extract the document title
and display it in the overview. This is especially useful when you
have to deal with cryptic filenames which will not let you get any
idea of the contents of the document itself.

If you are using the Netscape browser the program will make use of
Javascript for extended information about the files found like file
size, file date etc.

# NEW IN THIS VERSION 

- version 1.03

  - Bug fixes only. Now also works on CD drives. Please update.

- version 1.02

- Added command line switch /r to change the default drive range
  scanned by the program. You will now be able to choose either
  all local drives like before (default), all network drives
  or all accessible drives, i.e. all local and all network drives.

- Made recognition of html files more flexible, before only
  *.html and *.htm files were assumed to be html. You now can
  easily add own file extensions. Currently recognized as
  HTML are files which's file extension includes one of the
  following substrings: HTM ASP PHP

# PREREQUISITES

You should have OS/2 and classic REXX installed.

# USER SETUP

None.


# CALLING SYNTAX

The calling syntax will be also shown to you if you call the program
without any commandline arguments.


dirmap [/a /r<lna> /1 /2 /3 /n<map.htm> /-<def...>] <filemask> [...]

  /a: scan all disk drives
  /1: one HTML page for all files (default)
  /2: one HTML page per drive
  /3: one HTML page per directory
  /n: name of root page (default: dirmap.htm)
  /-: drives to be excluded
  /r: drive range: [l]ocal (default), [n]et, [a]ll 

Examples:

dirmap c:\netscape\cache\*.*htm? g:\hypertxt\html\*.*

=> Compile an overview for the two directories given and
   put it on one page, the root page. Look for HTML files
   only in the first directory and for all files in the 
   second directory given.

dirmap /a /3 /-ij *.*htm? *.gif *.jp*g

=> Compile an overview for all local disk drives, but exclude 
   drive i: and drive j:. Look for HTML, GIF and JPEG files and 
   make one HTML page for every directory.


# PROGRAM OUTPUT

The program output depends on which commandline arguments are used and
can get huge. It's a good idea to call the program in an empty
directory especially when you plan to use commandline argument /3.

E.g. when I call the program with commandline argument /3 on my home
PC it compiles 670 files resulting in approximately 4 megabytes.


# DISCLAIMER AND CREDITS

I originally wanted to call this program 'dir2html', but found out
that there already is a program out there with that name.

Thanks to Michel Plungjan <mplungjan@epo.nl> for testing this program
under Windows NT. (It failed.)

I also sent this program out to some beta testers, but never heard of
any of those again. It either means the program had no bugs or it
didn't fit their needs and they threw it away ;-)

Thanks to Fritz_Chwolka <Fritz_Chwolka@t-online.de> for beta testing
version 1.2

# BUG REPORT, COMMENTS ETC.

It would like to hear your comments, both positive and negative.  The
program does a satisfying job as far as myself is concerned, so if you
want it to be developed further, you should say so.
