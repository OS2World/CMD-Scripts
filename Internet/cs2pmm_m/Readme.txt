Cs2PMM_m.cmd is a freeware OS/2 REXX script which reads the .msg
and .sav files produced by Golden CommPass and converts them to a
format that can be imported to PMMail/2 (BluePrint Software Works,
Inc.).

The program does not use PMRexx or Vx-Rexx, etc. - it is installed
and operated from an OS/2 command prompt.

Installation:  Copy/move all of the files contained in the archive
that was downloaded to a directory which is on the system PATH.  To
see what directories are available on your PATH, type the following
at an OS/2 command prompt:

echo %path%

After copying/moving the files, change to the directory where they
were placed and type the following at the command prompt:

cs2pmm_m -h

The helpfile which will be displayed should tell you everything else
you need to know.  Comments are welcome to:

Hope this is as useful to you as it has been for me!
