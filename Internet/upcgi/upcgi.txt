       Short Description: A CGI script for uploading files 
        Long Description:
  A simple OS/2 REXX cgi-bin script to process
  HTML uploads-- it provides support for a
  FORM with enctype="multi-part/form",
  and with INPUT TYPE="FILE" elements. 
  This script will echo back the "parts" submitted (i.e.; the
  file that was uploaded), but you can easily modify it
  to do more interesting tasks.

      Proposed directory
           for placement:  /os2/apps/internet/www/util
