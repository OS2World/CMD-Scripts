14 Jan 2000. UpCGI A CGI script for uploading files 

UpCGI is a simple OS/2 REXX cgi-bin script to process
HTML uploads-- it provides support for an HTML FORM with 
ENCTYPE="multi-part/form" and <INPUT TYPE="FILE"> elements. 

The heart of UpCGI is the READ_MULTIPART procedure that is 
contained in the UPCGI.CMD and in the UPFILE.CMD files.
REXX Programmers familiar with CGI-BIN can use this procedure
to implement their own upload interfaces. 

UPCGI.CMD contains a simple example that can be used to 
display how READ_MULTIPART works -- this example will echo 
back the "parts" submitted (i.e.; the file that was uploaded). 
You can easily modify it to do more.

For non-programmers who need a simple upload-files-to-a-server
utility,  UPFILE.CMD and UPFILE.HTM can be used. You should
modify a few parameters in UPFILE.CMD, and you might want
to customize UPFILE.HTM.
