1. What is the MZPIP package for ?
=====================================

The Mozilla Plug-In Pack Installer allows you to install the
OS/2 Multimedia Plug-Ins for Netscape Communicator to Netscape
as well as to Mozilla in one step. It can also be installed on
Mozilla when Netscape Communicator is not installed.

The benefits are:

    no more manual unpack of the NSPIP executable required, as
this is completely handled by the included srcipt.

    no more manual copying of Plug-In DLLs from the Netscape to
the Mozilla installation

    no more installation or Netscape Communicator in order to
just get the Plug-In Pack installed.
