Put objst.exe into a directory on your path.

Install FeelX, just for awhile.  Or forever if you like what it does.

Install the RAPlayer.

Create an icon for the RAPlayer.

Make sure the RAPlayer session is set windowed and that
size=0 x:\tcpip\bin\vdostcp.sys is in the settings notebook under DOS device.

Drop the RAPlayer icon on the FeelX icon.

You now have the object handle for your RAPlayer icon in the clipboard.

Paste that number into RAGO.CMD replacing the number that's there.

Edit mailcap.cap to match the paths on your system.

Place mailcap.cap and extmap.ext in x:\tcpip\ext

Edit explorer.ini to change this section:

[advanced]
; advanced user settings - edit with care!
;
; mailcap= specifies full path to user mailcap file
; format is:  mime/type; program_name params %s
; example:    image/jpeg; jview -r %s
; no wildcards allowed, no piping, no unix commands
mailcap=x:\tcpip\etc\mailcap.cap
; extmap= specifies full path to user extension map file
; format is:  mime/type     extension_list
; example:    image/jpeg    jpg jpeg jpe
extmap=x:\tcpip\etc\extmap.ext

I have used x: in this doc.  You need to use whatever drive letter you use.

You're done.  Reboot (for luck), and run the Web Explorer.
Goto http://www.realaudio.com/
Pick something and play it.

Enjoy!


**** Really Important ****

If you have problems using this, make sure that some other Winsock app
works for you.  If not, you'll need to troubleshoot your Winsock
configuration.  If all is well, this method works.  If you are unable to
run any other Winsock app standalone, this will not work.

This package is simply a method to allow RealAudio from the Web Explorer.
It is not a "howto" on getting Winsock apps running under OS/2.  That is
your responsibility.
