Changes for Version 1.1a
------------------------

FEELX (THE MAIN PROGRAM):
=========================
 - Only those hotkeys are deleted from the message queue that are associated
   with an action
 - Ability to change hotkey-shift-combination. Use either the new "hotkey"-page
   of the WPS object or the hflag-flag of fxopt.
 - Access hotkeys from OS/2 FS sessions
 - Big Bug in the sliding focus feature removed. Because of this bug
   a) the combo-boxes didn't work (sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry)
   b) the system could hang when dragging a program object on the WPS
 - Activate all controls is now off per default. This feature is still
   available (fxopt all:on save  / WPS object, page 1)
 - ini-entry changed to FeelX11a (you can delete FeelX11)
 - New entry point: B2Desktop (this does work for native PM w/o WPS only!)
 - Init of Spooler (??)
 - tried to improve always on top (still problems left)
 - tried to improve shutdown
 - Minnie is shown as long as FeelX is initializing.
   (instead of 10 sec.)

Changes to FeelX objects:
=========================
 - switchto: new object
      name      a program name (e.g. e.exe, viewdoc.exe)
                forces FeelX to switch to that session. Useful with hotkeys!


WPS-Object:
===========
 - new page "hotkey" (shift modifier and Full-Screen-Hotkey support)
 - the default object name is now <WP_FEELX>
 - (rudimentary) "help" is now working

Tools:
======
 - The lines of fxopt.exe now depend on whether you use codepage 437 or 850 :-)
 - fxopt now supports:
        fshotkey:[yes|no]    Enable hotkey support from OS/2 Fullscreen
        delhotkey:[key]      delete a hotkey (e.g. delhotkey:f2)
        delhotkey:all        delete ALL hotkeys (=turn off)
        hflags:[c|s|a]       Turn on/off shift/alt/ctrl as hotkey shift flags

problems removed:
 - better work with screen savers

 - menus are easier to use

new features:
 - make use of 3-button mouse

   description language
 - while Ctrl is pressed the sliding focus is off
 - (menu) entry points are now (*=new):
     Menu in all 4 corners, Titlebar, Shell(right button), *Shell3(3rd buttton)
     *Desktop(DbClick left button), *Desktop(3rd button), *Hotkeys, *Startup

new functions:
 - lots of new functions for program launching
   - Define name, path, parameters (specify at run-time, use the clipboard), ...
   - redirect output to clipboard or a PM-Viewer
   - specify DOS-Settigs for Dos-programs
   - error message when program does not exist.
 - a very (,very) simple macro recorder

 - improved kill and pmkill and adapted to OS/2 2.1
 - window list menu and OS/2 windowlist ( quick switch still there)
 - (up to 10) Actionbars for PM/WPS
 - shutdown
 - start WPS objects (currently not very user-friendly)

WPS-Object:
===========
 - completly rewritten. I hope you like it!

Documentation:
==============
 - almost completly rewritten. I hope it is easier now.

Tools:
======
 - wpopen added (opens default view of WPS objects or current path)
 - wo added (fault-tolerant search of file(names))
 - isChild added (return code signals wether a command is the shell itself
   or a child of the shell).
 - fg now runs with full screen programs
   (but still requires popuppm to be running)
 - fg now runs even if it is the child of a child (...) of the shell
 - fg now runs in DOS shells.
 - callrx added to show integration of ext. prgs.
 - fxopt runs from DOS-session (full functionality)
 - other tools just recompiled

(... and still a lot of work left)
