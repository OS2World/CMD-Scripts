                        FeelX v1.1a
                        -----------

This package does contain only small changes. For information see v1.1 readme
below. To install v1.1a if you already installed *v1.1* follow these steps
(For upgrade v1.0 -> v1.1a see info below).


FEELX v1.1 -> v1.1a only

        1. If v1.1 WPS object is installed:
               - delete WPS-object (e.g. shredder)
           and - use uninstal
        2. REBOOT (necessary especially when installed as a WPS object)
        3. Exit FeelX by starting
               - fxopt (old fxopt v1.1 !!) quit
            or - using one of the menu items
        4. Copy new files over old files


New info:
    - Sorry, I forgot to mention that you can program FeelX with the
      FeelX.go (nowps.go) file
    - default name for startup-file is nowps.go if started as a WPS-replacement
      and feelx.go otherwise
    - For more info cf. changes.txt
    - To start a program that is not in the path please don't forget
      to specify the FULL qualified path in the program attribute.

Hotkey info:
    Some users were not very lucky about the hotkey feature. Mostly
    because all Ctrl-Shift-combinations were deleted from the message
    queue. This is not true any longer. The hotkeys can be a very
    powerful help. Have a look at the toolbox.inc file. It is loaded
    by feelx.go, the default description file. Some ideas are included
    there (section Default_Hotkeys). Almost all samples are commented out.
    Remove the comments, restart FeelX, try the hotkey (default: Ctrl-Alt+key)
    and modify the file to your own preferences.

ideas?
    - I don't want to make any promises about future versions - but I
      currently thinking of a more use-friendly way to define FeelX actions
      (menus, hotkeys, ...). If you have any good ideas, let me know
      (but don't expect miracales from the next version ...)
    - Furthermore I want to enhance the toolbox.inc file to make it easier
      to program FeelX. If you have any good idea for a FeelX object,
      or if you expect the FeelX language to do something that is not
      possible now, let me kow (or send me the FOOL-definition).
    - If you have problems to integrate your program or DLL, send me a mail
    - ideas for new objects are very welcome (it's easy to enhance FeelX)

Felix.

================================================================================
                        FeelX v1.1
                        ----------

The aim of this program (package) is:
  - simulate some X-Window features (sliding focus, PM - Kill, 3rd mouse button)
  - increase personal producuctivity by
        a) offering a lot of menus (may be used as a WPS replacement)
        b) easier mark & paste than standard OS/2
        c) some small stand-alone tools
        d) other features as described in FeelX.inf
  - increase your fun using OS/2 :-)

Features of v1.1
  - Same as v1.0 (WPS integration, context menus, ...)
 minus:
  - (some of the) bugs & problems
 plus:
  - new "special" functions: like hotkeys, windowlist(s), actionbar(s)
  - support of 3rd mouse button
  - much more flexibility (use a small language)
  - easier program launching (OS/2 [->clipbrd, ->pm], dos, win)

Additional programs:
  open WPS-object, fault-tolerant search for file(names), move
  program into foreground from a batch file, change lines in an OS/2 shell,
  change font in an OS/2 shell
