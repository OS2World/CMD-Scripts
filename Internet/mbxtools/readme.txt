These tools have been created to do a proper migration of .mbx Eudora files
 (Versions: Eudora Light v1.5.4, Eudora Pro 3.0) to ThunderBird / MozillaMail,
since direct copying of the .mbx files into ThunderBird's local mail folder
made it go nuts.

These tools are badly (and barely) documented because they're hardly intended
to be used more than once per user.

THEY MIGHT SEVERELY DAMAGE YOUR MBX FILES and should NOT be used without
having a look at the code first to get an idea of what they actually do and /
or consult myself about them.

DON'T SAY YOU HAVEN'T BEEN WARNED.

Still, after a week of tweaking and polishing the tools and fighting ThunderBird
(do you think old email programs suck? try this one!) I've managed to successfully
fix and migrate 61270+ emails (nearly 10 years worth of messages) in automated
fashion ;-)
