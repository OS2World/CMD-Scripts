News group list fetch v0.16

For whatever purpose, you may want a simple list of newsgroups without 
having to export from a news reader program.  

That's what this news group list fetcher is for.  

The usage:

ngfetch.cmd <host> [options]

<host> is the name of the news server you want to grab a list from.  All 
available groups will be downloaded and written to a file.  A progress 
indicator will be displayed, showing bytes transferred, and the rate of 
transfer, as well as the number of groups parsed.  

Options:

/q - Quiet mode.  No transfer status display.

/qq - Super quiet mode.  Suppresses all output.

/w - Write raw data to file.  No newsgroup parsing.

/s - Sort received newsgroups before writing (somewhat slow).

/b# - Specify transfer block size (512-65535).  Default is 10240.

/t# - Specify transfer status timing interval in 100ths of a second.
      Default is 50 (updated twice a second).

/m# - Specify maximum retries on socket receive errors.  Default is 1000.

You should note that the final size of .newsrc will not match the total 
bytes transferred, because the groups will have been parsed out of 
information pertaining to article numbers and posting permission.  If, for 
some reason, you want this information, just use the /w switch.  All
information will be written to .newsrc without any parsing.  Naturally, 
there will be no status information concerning the number of groups 
received using this switch.  If you have a fast connection, this will be 
much faster due to the lack of parsing.

At the end of the transfer, there will be a stats line with the number of 
bytes transferred, seconds of duration, and effective transfer rate.  If 
the /w switch is not used, there will be another line stating how many
groups were received.  

Exit codes:

0 - newsgroup list retrieval successful
1 - news host connection failed at socket level
2 - connection refused by remote server
3 - user aborted
4 - program error
5 - bad usage
