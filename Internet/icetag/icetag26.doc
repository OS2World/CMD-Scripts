IceTag/2 is  supplied as is without any warranties, expressed or implied.
The author assumes no liability for damages which may result from the use

Package Contents:
----------------

	icetag25.cmd    The main IceTag/2 (v2.5) REXX script.
	iceidx25.cmd	Indexing utility required for producing index file.
	pqf4.quo	This is the Pratchett Quotes file with several additions 
			by me.
	icetag25.doc	This is the file you're reading now.

Description:
------------

	IceTag/2 is a REXX script that gives you the ability of adding random
	tags or quotes to the end of any e-mail you send using PMMail. This ability
	is enhanced further by giving you the freedom of adding quotes of
	any length (you're not limited to a certain number of lines).


Requirements:
------------

	This program requires the following:
	
		1. OS/2 Warp 4.0 (Version 3.0 can also be used).
		2. REXX must be installed (comes included with OS/2 Warp).
		3. SouthSoft's PMMail 1.5 or above.
                                                   

New Features in this Release:
----------------------------

	- Improved Speed: this release is almost 50% faster than the previous releases.
	- You can see the quote before it gets added to the e-mail and if you don't like
	  it, you ask IceTag/2 to pull another one from the quote file.
	- Can remove the X-Mailer line or replace it with any string.
	- More control over the way the quote is added at the end.
		

Installation:
------------

1. Unzip the archive containing the program into a temporary directory.
2. Copy icetag25.cmd, iceidx25.cmd & pqf4.quo to you PMMail directory.
3. Change to the PMMail directory and edit the iceidx25.cmd file as required
   if you want to use a different quote file than the one included.
4. Run iceidx25.cmd to produce an index file (pqf4.idx)
5. From inside PMMail, pull down the "Account" menu and choose "Utilities
   Settings".
6. When the settings window appears, press on the "REXX" tab.
7. When there, turn on the "Message Send Exit" checkbox and enter the name
   of the script "icetag2.cmd" in the entry field below it.

Now you're done installing IceTag/2 with the basic configuration.

To test it, send an e-mail to yourself and you'll see that there's a quote
added at the end of the e-mail (if you want to read the quote, open your
e-mail in the "Sent Mail" folder).


Enabling new Features:
---------------------

	To enable the new features you have to set some flags inside the script
	itself (icetag25.cmd). Changes can be performed using your favorite
	text editor like E or EPM or any other editor.

Here's what the configuration section looks like:

/*               _   _               ___      _                 */
/*              | | | |___ ___ _ _  / __| ___| |_ _  _ _ __     */
/*              | |_| (_-</ -_) '_| \__ \/ -_)  _| || | '_ \    */
/*               \___//__/\___|_|   |___/\___|\__|\_,_| .__/    */
/*                                                    |_|       */


/* 1. Do you want to confirm each quote before it is applied to an
   outgoing e-mail? (0=NO - 1=Yes)                              */

Confirm=0

/* 2. Do you want a string inserted before each quote?          */
/* (0=NO - 1=Yes)                                               */

insert_prefix=0

/* 3. If you want a prefix other than the one below, change the
   value between the quotes.                                    */

prefix="... "

/* 4. Do you want a newline inserted before the quote?          */
/* (0=NO - 1=Yes)                                               */

insert_newline=0

/* 5. Do you want to replace the X-Mailer line in your header?  */
/* (0=NO - 1=Yes)                                               */

replace_xmailer=0

/* If answered YES to the above question then you can change the
   change the value below to something you prefer to replace the
   X-Mailer line with. Leaving nothing between the quotes removes
   the X-Mailer line completely.                                */

new_XMailer=""

/*--------------------------------------------------------------*/
/* End of User Setup section                                    */


These are the default values for the flags which will achieve the
following results:

	1. It's working in Silent Mode (it won't ask for confirmation
	   for the quote pulled from the file).
	2. It won't add anything before the quote.
	3. It won't insert a blank line before the quote starts.
	4. It won't replace the X-Mailer line.


Changing Mode to Interactive:
----------------------------

	To gain a bit of control over the quotes added, let the value of Confirm
	equal 1. And in the Account -> Utilities Settings -> REXX dialog, check the box
	under "Message Send Exit" entry field marked "Execute Script in Foreground".

	Now whenever you send a message a command window will popup and will look something
	like this:

________________________

"Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing."
        -- Wernher von Braun

Do you feel that this quote is appropriate (Y/N) ?
________________________

	If you answer with a "y" then the window will disappear and your 
	message will be processed after the quote gets appended to it. 
	But if you answer with a "n" a new quote will be pulled from the 
	file and you will be asked again to confirm adding it to your e-mail.


Adding a Prefix before the Quote:
--------------------------------

	Some people prefer to precede any quote added to their e-mails with 
	some characters like dots or dashes. To enable this feature, change
	the value of "insert_quote" to 1 and also change the prefix itself 
	(by changing the value of the variable "prefix" under the next question) 
	if you have a specific preference.


Inserting a Blank Line Before the Quote:
---------------------------------------

	If you prefer to have some space between your sig and the quote,
	change the value of "insert_newline" to 1.


Replacing the X-Mailer Line:
---------------------------

	Many people prefer to maintain their anonymity if their desire it
	but the X-Mailer line added to the header of every message they send 
	prevents that. For example, every e-mail I send has the following line 
	in the header:

	X-Mailer: Ahmad Al-Nusif's Registered PMMail 1.9 For OS/2

	So even if my name doesn't appear anywhere in the message body, all that 
	someone who wants to know the origin of the e-mail has to do is look at 
	the header and it won't be a secret anymore.

	So, if you want to remove this line completely, change the value of 
	"replace_xmailer" to 1. But if you want to replace it with something else 
	change "replace_xmailer" to 1 AND change "new_XMailer" to a different
	value. Leaving "new_XMailer" as an empty string	will only remove the 
	X-Mailer line.

	_NOTE_: I've seen some REXX scripts that do just that, so this is not
		the only program that can do this.

Adding More Quote to the File:
-----------------------------

	Adding more quotes to the quote file is simplicity itself. Just open
	the quote file (pqf4.quo) in E and add whatever quotes you like and 
	appending a "#" at the end of each one. Save the file and run iceidx25.cmd
	again to refresh the index file (pqf4.idx). Next time you send an e-mail, 
	there's a chance that one of your new quotes will get picked from the file.

       This program is E-mailware, i.e. send me an e-mail if you like/use it.
       But it's copyrighted to Ahmad Al-Nusif (morpheus@moc.kw) so you're
       not allowed to put your own name to it or use portions of it in your
       program without consulting me.


Note:

      If you have an attachment in your e-mail the quote will be appended
      after it. So if you send an e-mail with an attachment and then go
      to the sent mail folder to check the quote, you won't see it unless
      you press alt-v (which displays the attachment as text).
