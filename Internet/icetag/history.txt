IceTag/2 History of changes


Version 2.5: (first public version)

Features:       -Updated indexing method.
                -Introduced an Interactive mode for choosing quotes.
                -Speed improvements
                -Added ability to replace or remove X-Mailer line.


Version 2.6:

Bug-fixes:      -I made a mistake when preparing the archive to send to some
                 FTP sites. I included an older version of the indexing utility
                 that caused errors on startup. This version should solve this
                 problem.
