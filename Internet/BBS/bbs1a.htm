<!-- This is an alternative "BBS startup screen".
It first gets the username/password; and then calls
an alternate "customizable" startup page (BBS1B.HTM)
 -- the links to BBS on this start up page will typically pass
control to BBS.

You can modify  this document as you see fit, but please take note of the
comments about which lines should not be modified -->
