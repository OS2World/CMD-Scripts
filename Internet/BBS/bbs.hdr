<h2> BBS.HDR </h2>
This is a sample BBS Header file.<p>
You can put BBS header files in the <cede>BBS_PARAM_DIR</code> directory, and
in the various file directories.  BBS will first try to use
 the "header_file" in the target directory. If it can't find
such a file, it will then look in the BBS_PARAM_DIR directory.
If it still can't find the file, a generic header is used.

<P>Two <em>special strings</em> are manipulated by BBS:
<ol> 
<li>  &#36;SERVERNAME yields the server IP name (i.e.; $SERVERNAME
<li>  &#36;DIR yields the current directory (i.e.; $DIR)
</ol>

<blockquote>
<b>Important note</b>: if you use a header file, you <b>must</b>
include a &lt;BODY &gt; element at it's top.</blockquote>
