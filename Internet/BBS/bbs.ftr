<h3> BBS.FTR </h3>
This is an example of a bbs.ftr file.
It's use is equivalent to "header_files" (a version in the
target directory is used if available, otherwise the
bbs_param_dir directory is searched for a footer_file).
<p>
Two <em>special strings</eM> are manipulated by BBS:
<ol> 
<li>  &#36;SERVERNAME yields the server IP name (i.e.; $SERVERNAME
<li>  &#36;DIR yields the current directory (i.e.; $DIR)

</ol>
