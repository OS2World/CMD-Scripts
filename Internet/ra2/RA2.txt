Hello Everybody!

I have had Real Audio working under WARP CONNECT for about a week now
and I thought I would share my success with everyone.  I previously
tried to make it work with the instructions in the RA_WEBPK.ZIP file (
the one that needs the FEELIX and OBJST programs ), but I thought that
although some got it to work ( I didn't bother ), it was still too
complicated ...  after all this is OS/2!!  So here is my custom
solution:  Please enjoy it as much as I have and let me know how it
works for you.  Also I am just about finished with a REXX program that
will play your favorite Real Audio radio station via a LIST BOX ...  you
point at a predefined station and double click.  The advantage of this
code it that you DO NOT need to have WEBEX running at all, just be
connected!  I'll upload it as soon as it is ready.  Good luck!  Skip

1) Download and install the Real Audio client ( version 1.0 or 2.0 )

2) Find your explore.ini file ( should be in \mptn\etc if WARP CONNECT or
                                             \tcpip\etc if regular WARP )

   Edit the explore.ini so that the advanced section looks like this -

     [advanced]
     ; advanced user settings - edit with care!
     ;
     ; mailcap= specifies full path to user mailcap file
     ; format is:  mime/type; program_name params %s
     ; example:    image/jpeg; jview -r %s
     ; no wildcards allowed, no piping, no unix commands
     mailcap=c:\tcpip\etc\mailcap.cap
     ; extmap= specifies full path to user extension map file
     ; format is:  mime/type     extension_list
     ; example:    image/jpeg    jpg jpeg jpe
     extmap=c:\tcpip\etc\extmap.ext

   The two key lines are the mailcap= and extmap= ones.

3) Create the mailcap.cap and extmap.ext files.  They must be located
   in the directories pointed to by the above advanced settings in the
   explore.ini file.

   mailcap.cap should contain the following single line:

audio/x-pn-realaudio; c:\raplayer\ra2.cmd %s

   extmap.ext should contain the following single line:

audio/x-pn-realaudio ram ra

   The mailcap.cap file is how to add an external viewer to the WebEx
   and the extmap.ext sets up the extension association.

4) Place the REXX program ( RA2.CMD ) in the c:\raplayer
   directory.  If you boot from other than C: then you will need
   to adjust the hard coded 'C:' references in all of the files above
   and below, otherwise I don't believe you will have to modify any-
   thing to get it working.  The REXX code will put a Real Audio icon
   on your Desktop.  After you have done all this, then just dial in
   to the Internet and go find a Real Audio site like www.audionet.com
   and start listening.
