FIXIT.CMD - change your new PMMail v2.10 to use BE-Style icons or others

Notes:
^^^^^
I've included all the original BeOS-style icons from PMMail v1.91, and some
more icons from the original PMMail v2.0. Other icons are brand new, created
from me in the BeOS-style, to fit in the new PMMail 2.0 buttons.
Finally, I've added a 3D style to the "+" and "-" icons in the folders tree.

These icons are now included in the .\BEStyle subdirectory. If you want to
use them, copy PMMAIL.RES from the .\BEStyle directory to the directory where
FIXIT.CMD is.

In the .\RSelby directory you can find icons created and donated by Robb Selby 
(robbselby@zianet.com). If you want to use these, copy PMMAIL.RES from the
.\RSelby directory to the directory where FIXIT.CMD is. Many thanks go to Robb
for his nice work!


Other Thanks:
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Many thanks go to the original (unknown) creator of the FIXIT.ZIP package,
which made the substitutions on PMMail 1.92 (the first version to have the
ugly SouthSoft's icons).

Many thanks to Martin Lafaix too, for his great (free) resource editor.
I've included it in this package to facilitate things for the end-user.
I hope there's no problems with Martin for this.


Contact:

You can contact me at criguada@tin.it. Please don't try to contact me at
the old address cristiano.guadagnino@usa.net: although this address still
exists, I read it very seldomly, so you may have to wait for decades <g>.

Now for some installation instructions:
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. make a temporary directory ie. MD C:\BLAH

2. change to your temporary directory ie. CD C:\BLAH

3. unzip the ZIP file into the temporary directory you just created
   (unzip there the resmgr.zip file too)

4. copy PMMAIL.EXE file from your PMMAIL directory into your newly
   created temporary directory

5. rename your original \SOUTHSDE\PMMAIL\PMMAIL.EXE file to something
   like PMMAIL.BAK just incase something screws up during this patch
   program, or you wish to go back to the old icons

6. copy one of the PMMAIL.RES files into the directory where FIXIT.CMD
   lives (see "Notes" at the beginning of this file).

7. run the FIXIT.CMD program

8. copy the altered PMMAIL.EXE file into your original PMMail directory

9. delete and then recreate the PMMail desktop icon - this will update the
   icon used to represent the PMMail program (or just edit the path and
   wait till the next reboot to see the new icon)

You're done! You can now delete your temporary directory


Finally, be patient with my english: I'm not a native english speaker.
If you're using this package, please drop me an e-mail!
