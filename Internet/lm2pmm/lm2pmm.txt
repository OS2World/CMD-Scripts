This set of Object Rexx programs migrates LaMail-folders, LaMail-messages and 
LaMail nicknames (addresses) to the PM-Mail 1.9x format.

Files in archive:

   lmrxtool.cmd   ... set of Object Rexx definitions for LaMail structures
   lm_migr.cmd    ... control program for migration
   pmmrxtoo.cmd   ... set of Object Rexx definitions for PM-Mail 1.9x structures


Needs Object Rexx utilities stored in:

   http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/dev/orexx/orx8.zip


To invoke migration merely enter:

  lm_migr

Note: PM-Mail must not be running, else unpredictable errors may occur, hence
      the migration utility checks whether PM-Mail is running and if so aborts.

Good luck !
