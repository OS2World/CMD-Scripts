ver 1.0, May 20, 2002

WHAT IS THIS?

A Rexx script that allow you to read your PM Mail messages from
a web browser from elsewhere on the internet.  There is no 
ability to write messages, nor does it decode attachments.
It is intended to allow you to quickly check your messages
from a remote location.

In order to use this package you need the following on your system:
 - PM Mail v.1.96 as your email program
 - A web server with CGI capability (and connected to the Net)

------------------------------------------------------------------------
CAUTION!!! if you don't know how to configure the security settings on
your web server then don't even attempt installing this webmail reader!
Doing so will likely open up your private email to a global Audience.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

---installation---

STEP 1:

Place the 'Webmail.cmd' program in your web server's CGI-Bin 
directory.  Edit the Rexx file and set the following variable:
 PMMailDir = 'F:\App\SOUTHSDE\PMMAIL\'
to point to the directory where you have installed PMMail.

note: PM Mail does not need to be running in order for this utility
to work.  The Rexx file runs rampant through the directory
structure that PM Mail uses to store messages.

STEP 2:

Set up an access path to point "http://www.yourserver.co/webmail/"
to the same directory you entered in step 1.  PUT APPROPRIATE SECURITY
ON THIS ACCESS PATH!  If you don't know how, then stop and don't 
bother installing this package!

STEP 3:

Put a default file index.html into that same path to connect the CGI 
program with the accounts you want to access.  Example:

<html>
<body>
<a href="/bin/webmail.cmd?folder=ALEXDO0.ACT">INCENTRE.NET</a>
<p>
<a href="/bin/webmail.cmd?folder=ALEX_D0.ACT/">TELUS.NET</a>
</body></html>

STEP 4:

Fire up your browser and try it out.
