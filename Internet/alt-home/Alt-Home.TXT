Alt-Home.CMD, setting the right HOME directory for YARN
=======================================================


eComStation uses a HOME environment setting which name isn't unique, but
its default setting is wrong for many applications. An example is YARN.

WPS Program objects can have their own HOME=...-setting. Alt-Home.CMD is
aimed at a WPS Program object for YARN with such a HOME setting. 

Alt-Home.CMD assumes YARN is already installed properly. If not, it will
fail to complete some basic checks.


First it will ask what YARN's HOME environment setting (default: current
HOME environment setting). Next it will also ask where the file YARN.EXE
is (default: current YARN environment setting or the current directory).
And finally it will ask what the working directory for YARN is (default:
root directory of the first drive in use, typically C:\).

The working directory isn't that important. One fine day you may want to 
undelete a YARN file, and perhaps you may want to be able to notice some
file left behind by YARN. It shouldn't do that.


As usual any entered setting is adjustable, except the new HOME setting. 
Optionally delete the file Alt-Home.CMD after the WPS Program object for
YARN is created. 

Of course you may modify Alt-Home.CMD to install other applications with
yet another different (HOME) environment setting. The largest part of it 
is related to general and YARN-specific checks, but SysCreateObject() is
its most important generic part.


You won't need this at all, if you'ld write a YARN.CMD-wrapper like this
fancy example: 

   @MODE 132,43
   @HOME=C:\Internet Apps\YARN
   @C:
   @CD \
   @C:\Internet Apps\Bin\YARN.EXE

Alt-Home.CMD also can be modified to create this YARN.CMD-file. But that
isn't its goal, which is to create an object with a SET xxx=yyy-setting.
Hence its name. It may also be possible to patch YARN.EXE to use another
environment variable name.

If it actually would create such a YARN.CMD, I would perhaps like to see
it in an eCS install-checker. That's causing this "problem" in the first 
place, with the eCS setting of "HOME=C:\HOME\DEFAULT". This ain't Linux,
and it is possible to check for the few applications that will be broken
by such an (extra-) ordinary HOME-setting.
