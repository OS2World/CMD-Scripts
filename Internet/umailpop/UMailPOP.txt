UMailPOP.cmd
(C) Volker Weber, 1994

You can pick up internet mail from a POP3 server with LamPOP. Unfortunately
LamPOP does not work with UltiMail. This command file is a small workaround.
Use LamPOP to pick up you mail from the POP server; then transfer it with
UMailPOP to the Ultimedia Server. You will still have to send mail with
OS/2 SendMail.

Please edit the UMailPOP.cmd to suit you needs. You will have to replace my
username with yours and you may have to change a few directory entries.

UMailPOP is all but perfect, but it works for me. If you like it, send me a
short note.
