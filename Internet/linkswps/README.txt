This package contains some REXX scripts by David Mediavilla <davidme.forum@bigfoot.com>
that help you to integrate the Links textmode browser into OS/2's WPS. To install, unzip
the file into the directory where the Links executable (links.exe) is and run INSTALL-DME.CMD.
That should generate a Links object on your desktop and set some associations.

Now you can use Links with HTML files, URL objects, WebExplorer URL objects and even
Windows internet shortcuts.

The scripts are released under GPL.
