Citation:
   Headline News Viewer is based on  the  Deja News Reader  by
   Eric Walker (ftp.highboskage.com/dnreader)

   It also has some modified code taken from HTML_TXT by 
   Daniel Hellerstein 

Requirements:
   Headline News requires the following dynamic link libraries (DLL):
     REXXLIB.DLL and RXWIN30.DLL from Quercus Systems at
        http://www.quercus-sys.com/files/rexxlib.zip
     RXSOCK.DLL:  the IBM EWS RxSock library is usually installed with 
           OS/2. If you do not have a copy of RXSOCK.DLL, you  can find it at
           ftp.ibm.com/pub/pccbbs/os2_ews/rxsock.zip
   These DLL library files must be in your LIBPATH (say, in x:\os2\dll, where
      x: is your boot drive), or in the same directory as HL_NEWS.CMD

Installation:
  a)  Copy HL_NEWS.CMD, NEWS.CNF, sites_list, HL_install.CMD, Maint.CMD and 
      possibly the aforementioned DLLs to one of your applications directory.
        
  b)  Run HL_install.CMD. This creates a LOADS and SITES subdirectories 
      under this directory --   these are used for workspace.

  Caution:
       The  LOADS subdirectory is subject to bulk erasal -- 
       do NOT put anything in LOADS that you want to keep!

  c)  Start HL_News and select Maintenance, This will make a sites list.
      The sites list file is used to select which sites to download articles from.
      You may find this list rather long --  you can use the Maintenance
      mode f4 option to remove sites that don't interest you. If you want to 
      edit the sites list off line run Maint.CMD. 
      

Acknowlegements:

  * I must give specal thanks to Daniel Hellerstein author of HTML_TXT
    Without his help I would have probably not been able to get the text
    formatted in such a nice way.

Running Headline News:

   a)you must be online to run Headline News.

   b)News.cnf contains several user-configurable variables: 
    
    (line_len) is used to set the length of lines used when displaying
     articles (the default is 78).

    (Hi_asc) is used used to turn on or off the display of hi ascii characters 
     used in html markup. This may be turned on or off. 1=on 0=off

       *some characters may still show as this only controls &#num;
        elements of the markup.

      (h_mark) is used to set the character used to display headings 
      in a hierarchical outline.  the default is '' and will display
      indented with the number; for example:
            1)like so

         *you may set this to display a specific character buy using D2C(num)
          with num being a three digit number from 128 - 255

      (savesdir) is used to save articles to a specific directory. 
       This is a convenience, so that you don't have to enter a directory
       when saving articles to file. 
       For example:
          savesdir=homedir||'\SAVE\' 
       will save the file in the sub directory  named SAVE under 
       the directory that HL_News is started from.

          * To save the files in another directory enter the full path 
            in quotes. 
            For example:
               'C:\tcpip\tmp\' 
             will save the file in the tmp directory.


    c) Set up the site list and Maintenance 
             
       You can edit the site list to choose which sites Headline List 
       should obtain pages from.  This is done by using the Maintenance option 
       of HL_News. Or Maint.cmd to edit the site list
       offline.

       With the Maintenance option, you can: 
           1) Delete sites from the list.
           2) Edit a list to change the title of a site.
           3) Add a Horizontal rule or divider line to  sepertate groups of sites.
           4) Add sites that you are interested in getting articles from.
           5) Move a site to rearange the order of the list.

      available sites and load it for editing.

                                        * Selecting Articles *

            parameter (in News.cnf)

          * Caution: 
                The cursor is at the left end of the line -- so it must be
                moved to the proper location to before typing in the name
                (you can use the END key).

   wish to exit  (pressing the Y key will exit).

Caveats: 
     From time to time the news servers will move or discontinue an 
     article. If errors about (text start or text end) get frequent try 
     downloading a new list of articles.

          * At any time a site may decide to reformat their web pages
            making this program inoperable until changes are made.
