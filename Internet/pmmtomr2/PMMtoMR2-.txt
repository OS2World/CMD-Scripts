PMMtoMR2 - A program to convert PMMail nicknames, folders, and mail
           into the MR2Ice format.

PMMtoMR2 will migrate your existing PMMail address book and groups
into the MR2Ice address book maintaing real names, and addresses.
It will also migrate any groups you have defined in PMMail to
to MR2Ice groups.  Existing PMMail folders, with or without mail
in them, will be created for MR2Ice.

The program will prompt you for the drive where you have installed
PMMail if you have more than 1 drive (or multiple partions).
Please enter a single letter when prompted without the semi-colon.

You will also be asked if you want to move your mail from PMMail
into MR2Ice or if you want your mail copied.  If you choose to
move your mail make SURE you have a BACKUP in case something
should go wrong.  If you decide to move your mail, PPMtoMR2 will
clean up the PMMail folder directory structure and remove the
PMMail index files if you want it to.

Before PMMtoMR2 does anything it will check and make sure that
the drive where you have installed MR2Ice has enough room to
hold all of the mail you have stored in PMMail.

This is a "one time" use program so there is no registration fee.

If you found it helpful and were pleased with the results I would
appreciate US 5 dollars for the effort and testing I put into it.

If you are so inclined please send 5 dollars to:
