This package is designed to assist you in installing OS/2 FixPaks.

Most 'FixPak helper' packages are designed to painlessly installing one FixPak
onto one PC.  By contrast, this package allows you to create a directory tree
of FixPaks which you can use to install multiple FixPaks onto multiple OS/2
workstations.  This directory tree can be on a LAN drive, a CD-R(W), or just on
your local hard disk.

Of course, you can use this package to install single FixPaks if you want.


The following files are included:

    README.TXT      This introductory file.
    FIX-HOW.TXT     The main instructions.
    FIX.CMD         REXX script for installing FixPaks from a directory tree.
    DSKXTR12.ZIP    DSKXTRCT utility*.
    EXTRACT.CMD     Convenience wrapper for DSKXTRCT.EXE with simpler syntax.

    * You only need the file DSKXTRCT.EXE from the DSKXTR12.ZIP archive,
      but the whole package has been included in accordance with the program
      license.

Refer to the file FIX-HOW.TXT for instructions.
