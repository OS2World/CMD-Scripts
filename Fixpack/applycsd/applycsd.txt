My cultural background is such that I am prone to expend an inordinate
amount of energy to make my life easier.  Making life easier is the
entire objective of this little utility which largely automates the
application of fixpacks to IBM's Visual Age C++ compiler for OS/2.

I wrote a primitive version of this script about three years ago as an
aid to other developers on a project at IBM.  About one year ago I read
the notes concerning the recommended order for applying fixpacks and
although the primitive version had always worked for me, this new
version follows the recommended order.

Simply put all the fixpacks (as .zip files) that you wish to apply in
the same directory and from that directory execute this script.
A reboot is called for half way through after applying the WorkFrame
update (CTWnnn.ZIP).  Return to the fixpack directory and re-run the
script.   It will continue from the point where it left off.

The script invokes two external programs, unzip (Info-Zip version) and
rm.  I include rm.exe in the package.  I assume everyone already has
unzip.
