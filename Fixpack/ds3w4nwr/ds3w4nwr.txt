  Description:
  ------------
  DS3W4NWR.CMD is a REXX script that patches DualStor v3.0 so that it
  will run on OS/2 Warp v4.0, even if the Novell Netware Requester is
  installed. This patch will disable all netware support in DualStor
  v3.0, however, you will still be able to backup and restore from
  mapped drives.


  Disclaimer:
  -----------
  This is not an official patch from IBM. Neither IBM nor the author of
  this patch shall be held responsible for any losses that might occur
  from applying this patch or from using the patched version of DualStor
  v3.0 for OS/2.

  Problem Description:
  --------------------
  DualStor crashes on Warp v4.0 if the Novell Requester is installed.

  Error message: E:\APPS\DUALSTOR\DUALSTRP.EXE

  If you experience this error, then this patch might help you get
  DualStor up and running.

  Note: This patch might also work if you are experiencing problems with
        the Netware Requester v2.11c5 on Warp v3.0


  Applying the patch:
  -------------------
  * Copy the DS3W4NWR.CMD file to the directory where you installed
    DualStor (typically C:\DUALSTOR).
  * Make a backup copy of the DUALSTRP.EXE file
  * Run the DS3W4NWR.CMD script

  IMPORTANT: Do not apply this patch if you have previously applied any
             patch for DualStor that modifies or replaces the
             DUALSTRP.EXE file.


  What the patch does:
  --------------------
  When DualStor starts, it seems to detect if the netware requester is
  installed by trying to load the NWCALLS.DLL. What this patch does is
  that it makes DualStor try to load a DLL called "DS3W4NW.DLL" instead,
  and since that DLL does not exist, DualStor does not detect any
  installed netware requester. Note that this effectively disables all
  netware support in DualStor v3.0. However, you can still backup from
  and restore to mapped drives.

  The other thing this patch does, is that it modifies the Product
  Information window to display "Unofficial patch for Warp v4.0 Novell
  Requester has been applied.".
