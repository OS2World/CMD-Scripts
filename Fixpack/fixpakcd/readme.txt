This package contains the following files:

  READ.ME           This file
  FIXPAK-HOW.TXT    Instructions for creating a CD of directly installable
                    FixPaks
  FIX.CMD           REXX script for installing FixPaks off CD
  APPLYFIX.CMD      Alternate REXX script for more advanced users
  DSKXTR12.ZIP      DSKXTRCT utility (only DSKXTRCT.EXE is needed)
  DIUNPACK.EXE      IBM DIUNPACK utility, an alternate to DSKXTRCT; use of
                    this program is discouraged (use DSKXTRCT instead).

Refer to the file FIXPAK-HOW.TXT for instructions.

You only need the file DSKXTRCT.EXE from the DSKXTR12.ZIP archive, but the
whole package has been included in accordance with the program license.

DIUNPACK.EXE is provided in case you come across diskette image files that
DSKXTRCT isn't capable of handling.  Hopefully this should never happen.
DIUNPACK doesn't error-check the diskette images as it extracts them, so
it's less safe.


Of course, the contents of this package are all provided "as-is" with no
warranty.  If it destroys your system, I'm not responsible.

Remember: make backups before applying any fixpak.  And always read the
README first!
