Welcome to WarpFix for OS/2 Warp 4!

This collection of scripts will ease the installation of
a FixPak for OS/2 Warp 4.

----------------------------------------------------------
You're in a hurry?

If you have a normal Warp 4 Installation, Netscape and an
online Internet connection:

==> Just doubleclick on Setup.sgs.
----------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------
You are a Warp 3 User?

The scripts aren't tested with Warp 3, but besides the 
SGuide script Setup.sgs everything should work.
Copy RSUCSF.ZIP from 
ftp://ftp.boulder.ibm.com/ps/products/os2/rsu/rsucsf.zip
to the WarpFix directory and run InstFix.cmd manually.
----------------------------------------------------------


----------------------------------------------------------
You already got RSUCSF.ZIP?

If you already got RSUCSF.ZIP, move or copy the files 
InstRSUC.cmd, CreatFix.cmd, InstFix.cmd and Setup.sgs to 
the directory where you place the RSUCSF.ZIP file.

Hint: You don't have to unpack RSUCSF.ZIP!
----------------------------------------------------------


If you haven't got the RSUCSF.ZIP archive, go online with
the Internet and doubleclick Setup.sgs

The scripts will unpack the RSUCSF.ZIP archive to 
x:\OS2\INSTALL\RSUCSF, where x: is your OS/2 installation
drive.


----------------------------------------------------------
Where do I get FixPaks for OS/2?

IBM distributes identical FixPaks in different package 
types, all of them are found at 
ftp://ftp.boulder.ibm.com/ps/products/os2 and its
subdirectories.

The package type you should get are the RSU-packages,
which are usually placed at
ftp://ftp.boulder.ibm.com/ps/products/os2/rsu

Read the FixPak documentation on the same site to learn
about FixPak naming conventions.
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
You got RSUCSF.ZIP and a RSU-Fixpak-Zipfile?

Just place the WarpFix scripts together with the 
RSUCSF.ZIP file into one directory, unpack the 
RSU-Fixpak-Zipfile into any (empty) directory.

Doubleclick on Setup.sgs (on Warp 4) and read page 2 
and 3, or run InstFix.cmd (on Warp 3).

Open the directory with the unpacked FixPak via the WPS.
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
What else do I need to know?

For any problems, questions, or information about the
FixPak refer to the FixPak documentation and ask your
IBM representative :-) (this is a person unequal to 
myself!)
----------------------------------------------------------

----------------------------------------------------------
What's new? 

(Evening of November 18th)
Version 1.1 just loads all the REXX-Utility functions with
alls scripts.

(November 19th)
Discovered another EasyFix package on CDROM.COM. Thus I
renamed my script collection to WarpFix to avoid 
confusion. I guess, releasing three versions within 24h
and renaming the last one confuse everyone, don't you
think?
----------------------------------------------------------

Okay, I guess that's all you need to know about WarpFix.

Oh, almost forgotten: Enjoy reading the License.txt _prior
to the usage of WarpFix_!

Nevertheless have fun! :-)
