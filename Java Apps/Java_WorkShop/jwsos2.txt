Description:
------------
Java WorkShop startup script
This file was created by Cristiano Guadagnino


Installation notes:
-------------------
I have used the intel-solaris package to install JWS on OS/2.
Note that you only need the \JWS directory from that archive.
After extracting the JWS directory, you will have the following tree
on disk (only first level deep is shown):

\jws--+
      |
      +--classes
      |
      +--examples
      |
      +--intel-S2
      |
      +--lib
      |
      +--solaris
      |
      \--src

Now add an OS2 subdirectory, and a bin subdirectory under that,
so that you have:

\jws--+
      |
      +--classes--+(etc)
      |
      .
      .
      .
      |
      +--src--+(etc)
      |
      +--OS2--+
              |
              +--bin

Now, copy jws.cmd and jws.ico in the newly created 'bin' directory.
You're done!
Change to the \jws\OS2\bin directory and type jws (enter)...
Java WorkShop will come up!


Additional notes:
-----------------
1)This script works well if you're using 4OS2 or a (ported) unix shell.
  If you're using plain cmd.exe, you'll get the following error:

  SYS1079: >& was unexpected at this time.

  To correct this, edit the jws.cmd file and search for '>& \dev\null'
  (without quotes). Then correct it into '2> NUL'. You shouldn't have
  any more errors.

2)This script assumes that JAVA_HOME environment variable is already set
  and that the script is run from \JWS\OS2\BIN.

3)Note that jws.ut.platform is hardcoded. If you don't know what this means,
  don't worry: it's not important.

4)Be sure to use JDK 1.0.2 GA release. You can find it on the IBM sites.
  If you don't find it, go to http://www.cincyteamos2.org and look in the
  'Master OS/2 Warp Update List'. You'll find a pointer to the JDK.
                       DO NOT USE THE ALPHA JDK 1.1!!


Known bugs:
-----------
Whenever you try to build a project, jws reports the following error:

"javac: invalid flag: -jws"

I've not been able to track down what is causing this behaviour.
One user reported that the -jws flag is automatically added from JWS.
I can't understand why: no java compiler can't understand it. :-?
Perhaps SUN has delivered a skightly modified JDK with JWS.
BTW, we must live with this bug, at least until SUN continues
to ignore OS/2. :(

Final word:
-----------
Hope this file is much more clear than the previous one.
So many people wrote me because they didn't understand how to install JWS,
and even more wrote me about the problem with SYS1079.
This should be fixed now.
Anyway, feel free to write me if you have problems;
I'm glad to hear your comments.

Oh, and if you want to modify the script or this file AND spread it over the
net, please state clearly what YOU have done.
A good practice would be to add a description file separated from this one,
with your name and electronic address. In the script you can highlight the
changed code with some comment lines.
Whatever you do, ALWAYS include all of my files in the distribution.
I'm saying this because some time ago I found on hobbes a modified copy of
this archive, and people were asking me about things I NEVER WROTE.
OK, you're warned :-)
