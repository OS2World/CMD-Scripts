    Setup script for ICQjava under OS/2
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    Creates OS/2 desktop object for ICQjava
    Rewrites icq.cmd for you. (though you won't need it.)
    Includes 2 icons for ICQ so you have a choice.

    Installation of ICQ Java
    ------------------------

    Make sure you have JAVA 1.1.4 installed (plus current refresh)
    Get ICQ Java from   www.icq.com

    Make a path for it.  ie  x:\ICQjava
    extract package to that path.
    place all files from this package in that path.
    run ICQSETUP.CMD

    To use ICQ Java, Just Double Click on the Object on your Desktop, and
    use as instructed on www.icq.com.

    The Desktop Object is functionally identical to the ICQ.CMD. Except
    that unlike the icq.cmd, you won't have a VIO window running also.
    This runs the ICQ Java App directly.

    Enjoy.
