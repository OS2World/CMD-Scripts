The accompanying batch file is meant to set various tweaks for the infinality patches to the freetype font engine (see mzfreetyp2_beta1.zip et seq).

If starting a Mozilla app or qpdfview from a wrapper:

1. In the wrapper, set the USE_STYLE variable to whichever suits your taste (see the comments in the file and experiment).
2. Call this .CMD file to set the local environment.
3. Start the Mozilla app (or qpdfview, etc.).

If setting this in the master environment:

1. In CONFIG.SYS, set the USE_STYLE variable to whichever suits your taste (see the comments in the file and experiment).
2. Call this .CMD file from CONFIG.SYS to set the master environment.

Any settings in the master environment may be overridden in any local environment. Thus, it is possible to start with a system-wide default, and set various applications as desired.

This is a quick hack of the infinality-settings.sh shell script in the official package.

== Caveats ==

When setting the USE_STYLE variable, you *must* use the name of one of the defined styles in the file, to wit:

DEFAULT          - No setting is necessary (this will be selected "by default"). A compromise that should please most people.
OSX              - Simulate OSX rendering
IPAD             - Simulate iPad rendering
UBUNTU           - Simulate Ubuntu rendering
LINUX            - Generic "Linux" style - no snapping or certain other tweaks
WINDOWSXP        - Simulate Windows rendering with normal glyphs
WINDOWSXPLIGHT   - Simulate Windows rendering with lighter glyphs
WINDOWS7         - Simulate Windows 7 rendering with normal glyphs
WINDOWS7LIGHT    - Simulate Windows 7 rendering with lighter glyphs
ECS              - Based on "Linux" style - no snapping or certain other tweaks
VANILLA          - Just subpixel hinting
CUSTOM           - Your own choice.  Set various items to suit.
----- Infinality styles -----
CLASSIC          - Infinality rendering circa 2010.  No snapping.
NUDGE            - CLASSIC with lightly stem snapping and tweaks
PUSH             - CLASSIC with medium stem snapping and tweaks
SHOVE            - Full stem snapping and tweaks without sharpening
SHARPENED        - Full stem snapping, tweaks, and Windows-style sharpening
INFINALITY       - Settings the developer uses
DISABLED         - Act as though running without the extra infinality enhancements (just subpixel hinting).

Most shells I've used under OS/2 are case-insensitive, but test to be certain (e.g., SET USE_STYLE=ECS and SET USE_STYLE=ecs should both work). There is currently no error checking for misspellings.

== Why batch and not REXX? ==

It is clumsy (for me, at least) to set the master enviornment from REXX, as REXX provides no direct method for doing that (as far as I know). Further, it's kind of difficult to call a REXX procedure from CONFIG.SYS. Truly, the point of this is to make it the most universally-applicable file for setting a bunch of environment variables, and what better than to just run some batch?
