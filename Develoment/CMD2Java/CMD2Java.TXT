CMD2Java.CMD v2.0.0
===================

Rexx2Nrx uses *.BAT files and Java-options, which won't work with OS/2.
CMD2Java creates *.CMD versions of all Rexx2Nrx *.BAT files required to
convert Rexx applications to Java classes. 


TestFile.CMD
============

Assuming a working Rexx2Nrx installation, this file can be used to test
the files created by CMD2Java by executing:

   Rexx2Nrx.CMD TestFile
   java TestFile.class

Please note that Java v1.2+ is not required to execute this class file,
so eComStation's default Java v1.1.8 can be used to execute this file.

If the file TestFile.CMD cannot be found in the current directory, then
CMD2Java.CMD won't display how to use this sample.


Installation
============

Save CMD2Java.CMD in your Rexx2Nrx directory. Execute CMD2Java.CMD once
in that directory. CMD2Java verifies the CLASSPATH environment variable
and tries to find a Java-version which is at least version 1.2. 

You may delete CMD2Java.CMD, CMD2Java.TXT (this file), TestFile.CMD and
all *.BAT files of Rexx2Nrx which are now "replaced" by *.CMD files:

   NETREXXC.BAT
   NRC.BAT
   REXX2NRX.BAT
   REX_NRX.BAT
   REX_PARS.BAT
   REX_TYPE.BAT


It is possible to execute CMD2Java.CMD more than once, but it will fail
if at least one of the new files already exists. Delete all created new 
CMD files before executing CMD2Java.CMD again. No files are overwritten
by CMD2Java.CMD itself. CMD2Java.CMD also doesn't change your setup.


Requirements
============

Rexx, RexxUtil.DLL, Java v1.2+, NetRexx v2.0.5+ and Rexx2Nrx v4.0.1+.


Errors
======

 - Execute CMD2Java.CMD in the Rexx2Nrx-directory

This is the directory where the file Rexx2Nrx.jar is already installed.
All other Rexx2Nrx files may be required too.

 - File NetRexxC.jar not found in <DIRECTORY>
 - File Rexx2Nrx.jar not found in <DIRECTORY>

The CLASSPATH environment variable doesn't match the current situation.
Update the CLASSPATH, or copy/move files to the right directory.

 - Add the full file specification of NetRexxC.jar to the CLASSPATH
 - Add the full file specification of Rexx2Nrx.jar to the CLASSPATH
   
Install NetRexx or Rexx2Nrx properly, or update the CLASSPATH setting.

 - Java-version is not at least 1.2
 
The system reported an unexpected Java version. Java v1.2 or newer is a
requirement. Optionally edit CMD2Java.CMD to bypass/remove the test. It
should work with a default eComStation v1.2 install.

 - No directory entered
 - <DIRECTORY> is not a valid full path of a directory

Enter a valid full path, like: C:\PROGRAMS\JAVA142

 - File JAVA.EXE not found in <DIRECTORY>

Enter a directory where Java v1.2 can be found, or repair your system's
setting.

 - File <FILE> already exists

CMD2Java.CMD won't overwrite existing files. Delete the files manually. 
The files which CMD2Java.CMD tries to create are, in reversed order:

   NETREXXC.CMD
   NRC.CMD   
   REX_TYPE.CMD
   REX_PARS.CMD
   REX_NRX.CMD
   REXX2NRX.CMD
