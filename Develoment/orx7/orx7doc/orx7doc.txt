Contains the three introductionary articles to Object Rexx which refer to the
appropriate talks given on the 7th International Rexx Symposium in Austin/Texas
in May 1996.  The article "analyze.ps" is needed for exploiting the separate
orx7.zip package:

     local.ps ...... explains Object Rexx' concept of "environment", full
                     title: "Local Environment and Scopes in Object Rexx"

     class.ps ...... explains Object Rexx' implementation of classes, full
                     title: "Object Classes, Meta Classes and Method 
                     Resolution in Object Rexx"

     analyze.ps .... documents ORX_Analyze.cmd and the usage of
                     orx_analyze_ascii.cmd and orx_analyze_html.cmd, full
                     title: "ORX_Analyze.cmd - A Program for Analyzing
                     Directives and Signatures of Object Rexx Programs"

These three papers were written for RexxLA (Rexx Language Association,
http://www.RexxLA.org) to be included in the proceedings for the "7th
International Rexx Symposium" which took place in Austin/Texas/USA in May
1996.
