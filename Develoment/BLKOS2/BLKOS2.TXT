REGISTRATION FOR INDIVIDUALS IN NON-ORGANIZATIONAL ENVIRONMENT:
The registration for BLKOS2 is a one time fee of $3.00(three) US for this and all future 
versions which is to help defray the cost of obtaining OS2 development tools so that we
can offer some of the best priced os2 SW around.We have VERY radical ideas 
concerning SW pricing which we KNOW users will like.

CONTACT KUTEK FOR USE IN ORGANIZATIONAL SETTINGS.

FEATURES:
---REXX INTERPRET function with command line editing and history

---expanded history functions

---expanded command line editing functions

---file name completion

---run any command or program  on selectable groups of objects

---global and local object searches(across entire system) and operations

---manipulate the WPS directly from the command line to open filelist views of folders,
start objects or open settings views.

---attribute selector allows locating files on basis of date ,file attribute, time or 
size in a very flexible way

---full alias facility that gives hot key like access to your entire system.Both  named
and key aliases are supported.

---use all constucts of os2 batch language, os2 commands, external commands or 
functions and all rexx constucts within a single rexx alias.

---recursive directory delete, quick dir change and dir stack functions.

---manage files using a text based search mode that simplfies finding what you want 
anywhere on your system.

ADDITIONAL FEATURES COMING VERY SOON

the object configurator is an integral part of BLKOS2 that allows the easy configuration 
of os2, win or dos sessions. It can immediately create or modify objects without the 
necessity of writing rexx wps scripts and it creates a database of your objects so that 
they  can be recreated at any time on any os2 equipped system.The presence of 
BLKOS2 on the target system is NOT required for the object recreation process.
The OBJECT CONFIGURATOR will soon be integrated into blkos2 and released 
when tested.There is no additional fee for registered individual users of BLKOS2.

It is also our plan to integrate the capabilities gained through Dave Boll's RXU10
rexx utility package into blkos2(esp making it multithreaded).

BACK UP YOUR SYSTEM BEFORE USING THIS PROGRAM!!!
WE WILL NOT BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DATA 
LOSS OR OTHER DAMAGE TO YOUR SYSTEM-
THOUGH OUR TESTING DEMONSTRATES THAT IT IS SAFE,USE 
AT YOUR OWN RISK !!!!!!

the pgm runs as a shell on top of the command line ,intercepts
keystrokes and performs specified actions .
The prgram has a full alias facility which can use OS2 , os2
batch(CMD), or REXX commands freely in combination in
your aliases.There are no limits on the size of
an alias.BLKOS2 also allows various flexible search and
run functions as well as control over the WPS from the command line.
You need to have some  knowledge of rexx in order to use blkos2 
most effectively-refer to the online rexx docs.
INSTALLATION:
You must have REXX installed on your os2 system.
Blackstone requires the rexx updates in any of the following forms:
rexx20.zip, the service pak, or os2 2.1
The rexxutil functions will be automatically loaded if they are not active.

Modify the pather variable(in CAPS) at the top of the BLKOS2.CMD
file to specify the locaton of blackstone's auxiliary work files
.keeping all of the blackstone files in one dir is a good idea.
Place blkos2's directory  in your dpath and path statements.
Create  an os2 session object(windowed or FS,FS is faster,windowed
is more flexible)
and place the following in the parameter line:  /k blkos2.cmd.
use 25 line video mode.You'll have to live with our ansi choices for the
time being-make sure ansi is ON.The menus are intentionally 
minimalist.
You can also  change the runworkplace = CMD.exe
to runworkplace=<path>BLKOS2.cmd and it will load
automatically in all of your OS2 sessions as the shell.

add the following line to your STARTUP.CMD:

del pather\history\* /n
replacing pather with it's setting and enclosing the above in single 
quotes if your STARTUP.CMD  is a REXX file.

It is advisable to use a session hotkey facility such as QWIKSWCH
to switch easily between windows.
Modify the limtt var for the desired number of lines in the command history
buffer and set the logon parameter to 1 if you want the log to be 
active as default-you can switch it  on or off at any time from the 
keyboard.see below.Note that only those commands or input issued directly through
BLKOS2 appear in the log.

SETTING THE PROMPT COLOR:
in the configure block the prpt variable sets the prompt color.Use standard
ansi foreground color designators ie:31 -> red,32 -> green,33 -> yellow,
34-> blu,35->mag,36->cyan,37->white

SETTING THE SKIP VARIABLE: 
slow drives like cdroms can really bog down
a global search and by setting the skip variable in the configure block (at the top of
the blkos2.cmd file )you can exclude such drives from global searches. the skip variable 
is a space delimited string of drive specs in single quotes
EXAMPLE to exclude drives c x and w set 

SKIP='C: X: W:'             quotes,colons,spaces, and capitalization REQUIRED

SETTING HOW BLKOS2 DOES IT'S SEARCHES IN THE SELECTOR:
BLKOS2 is set up to search the entirety of the current drive if no drive
or directory is entered in a select term(see below). If you prefer that it 
only search the current directory and below thus giving a smaller pick
list display then set  TOTDRV=0 in the configure block at the top of the BLKOS2.CMD
file.HITTING ALT-S AT ANY TIME FROM THE MAIN PROMPT FLIPS THE 
SEARCH MODE

PLACING THE BLKOS2 WINDOW:
Keep the"collapsed"  window as a strip sized window at the bottom-
you can immediatly go to maximized by hitting ALT and ENTER in 
sequence.This will allow you to easily see a WPS file list that BLKOS2
brings up-they do not come to the front of the os2 session window.
Fixate the window size by left clicking on the title bar once while 
holding down shift.

EXITING BLKOS2 WITHOUT CLOSING THE OS2 SESSION:
Blkos2 can be exited at any time by typing exit on the command line and
invoking the rexx interpret function(see below.). The session will remain open
at the OS2 default command processor prompt.


SPECIAL KEYS FROM THE MAIN PROMPT:

ALT-S: switches the search mode(entire drive or current dir and below)

F1: brings up help

F2- STARTS ALIAS CREATION MODE -just follow the on screen instructions.
aliases can be saved to a permanent MASTER.ALS file found in
blackstones dir and they will automatiaclly be reloaded when it
is restarted.Aliases can be of any length and any rexx or cmd contruct
can be used in them. external OS2 functions are used via a call 
statement within quotes as in rexx.You do not use the comment to 
specify that you are using rexx, just type in your instructions.
The parameter variables are x.2 x.3.x.4.....x.n.These refer to parameters
on the command line when the alias is issued as in %X parameters
except that you can have an arbitrary number of them without using 
shift.NOTE:  YOU START WITH x.2 FOR THE FIRST PARAMETER,x.3 
FOR THE SECOND etc-THE x's MUST BE LOWER CASE.

If you are having trouble running an OS2 instruction,try putting it
in quotes(not it's variables) or using the call statement(in quotes)
Note: reusing an alias key erases the original.
You can create key or character aliases.The alias creation process will 
call epm as it's editor.key aliases only have a number as an identifier so
you need to input the key combination into the comment so that you'll 
remember it.
Follow the instructions after pressing F2 to complete alias 
creation/activation.

F3-- reloads the permanent aliases from the master.als file.
 some sample aliases are included.Sometimes the comments are not 
displayed correctly when using the F4 function,exit the F4 function
by hitting ESC and then hit press F3 a couple of times.

F4--displays a selector list for the active aliases.use as a reference
of what is currently active or start an alias directly by highlighting it
and pressing enter. curently,aliases that require parameters must be
started from the command line .

F5--brings the line constructed  with the selector to the command line for
further editing before execution.Press F5 BEFORE enter or CTRL-F1
when using the selector from the main prompt.This is useful for adding eg a file name
to a long dir path found with the selector.

F6--rename an alias in the master file-type the alias key and then hit F6;
follow on screen instructions

F7--remove an alias from memory-input the alias key and then hit F7

F8--remove an alias from the master file -input  the alias key and hit F8

NOTE: for key aliases you input the hexx number you see on the
alias list in the first column in the above 3 functions.

F9--places a command from the history box onto the command line
for editing

F10-places whatever is on the command line into the history buffer.
useful if you forget to do something and don't want to retype what 
has already been entered.

F11--char string search in file list. after placing a search string on the
CL hit F11 before hitting enter.This searches through a drive's filelist
for any occurrences of the search string and displays in a pick list.
This is different than the normal file search in that it is doing a TEXT
search of the FILELIST for ANY occurences ANYWHERE of the 
specified pattern.The 2 styles of search should allow you to find 
almost anything quickly and easily.When used without the attribute 
function this applies to all search terms on the command line. To
specify its use only for certain terms see attribute select below.

F12- starts a utility called keyhex which gives the hex representation
for the next key pressed after F12.single byte chars are 2 digits and
double are 4. observe the key alias funtion to see how they can be
 used.Also refer to the master select statement in the program body.

THE INTERPRET REXX FUNCTION:
ALT - ~(the key above tab and to the left of one) hit this after typing in
a short one line rexx pgm to have it immedately interpreted and run.
this is like the rexxtry command but better as you have history and line 
editing available.separate statements that would appear on different
lines in a normal rexx pgm by semicolons.A do loop must be a
complete do loop on a single line-it cannot span multiple line entries
Example: type

s=sysfiletree('c:\',stem,bs);do i=1 to stem.0;say stem.i;end

and hit alt - ~. the rexx file listing for the c drive will display.

Use ALT-~ to try out rexx commands or to verify syntax , usage,
or function.


THE SELECTOR FUNCTION:
The selector function allows you to operate on groups of files with
a single command, or to operate on a file or dir whose name is only
partially specified or whose location is unknown.
you do not issue a separate command in blkos2 for filename
completion or the select function.Type your command and preface
any item with a [ for the select to be activated. If you know
that a variable refers to a dir then put a [ at the end of it and only
dirs will be searched for/displayed for that variable/pattern.

example
type copy  [c:co  [d:ab[

to select and complete and copy  
c:\low\higher\higherstill\conflagration.exe to
the directory d:\top\lower\lowerstill\stilllower\absolutezero
chose from the displayed list.
all commands and aliases can use this feature.

SELECTOR LIST CONTROLS:
left arrow- tag entry and move scroll bar downward
right arrow-untag highlighted entry
up arrow-move scrollbar up
down arrow-scrollbar down
page up-previous page
page down-next page

CTRL-up arrow: tags all entries

CTRL-down arrow-untags all entries

CTRL left arrow:scroll file list left

CTRL-right arrow:scroll file list right

HOME AND END-go to the beginning or end of the 
displayed select list respectively

ALT left arrow- flips tags

a selected file listing will appear green.

THE WHERE FUNCTION:
a [  BEFORE a filespec alone on the command linel  is the WHERE function
or SELECT TO RUN- function -highlight an entry and hit enter if an 
exe and that pgm will run, or use it to locate a file to route to the command line

a [  AFTER a filespec will search only for Directories matching the pattern


EXAMPLE [f:cm displays all files in current dir and below starting with
the letters "cm".

example: [*.sys displays all SYS files
example:[ba[ searches for directories beginning with letters "ba"
example:[ba*.cmd  searches for all CMD files beginning with  the letters
ba
Searches are not case sensitive.

THE GLOBAL SYSTEM WIDE WHERE FUNCTION:

the [[ (two unshifted brackets-> key to right of p) before a term or filespec is 
the ALL DRIVE GLOBAL SEARCH/SELECT
this will search all of your available hard drives for files matching the 
input pattern,as above and is used in the same way as the [

example:[[*.exe lists all executables on your entire system.


DO NOT LEAVE A SPACE BETWEEN THE BRACKETS AND THE
FILE SPEC IN THE ABOVE.

A line at the command prompt  can have any number of terms to 
complete or select BUT ONLY ONE TERM CAN HAVE MULTIPLE
SELECTIONS.
EXAMPLE:
copy [*.cmd   [[xcv[
select EITHER multiple .cmds OR multiple dirs starting with letters
 xcv BUT NOT BOTH.In the first case multiple
files are copied to one dir; in  the second case one file is copied to 
multiple
dirs. One line can have ANY number of filename complete searches 
as long as only one  term has multiple selections.

GENERATING A "LIST OF FILES"  FILE  FOR INPUT TO A COMMAND 
THAT USES SUCH:

some programs accept a file name for a file that contains a list 
of file specs upon which that program should operate.When available
generating such a list is desirable rather than using select to run 
the pgm or command multiple times as the setup time for the 
pgm/command is not repeatedly incurred.Any term on which you
can use select can be made to generate a unique file list for that term
and the filename and path is automatically passed to the command.
The following is the command format for one such pgm-PKZIP from the pkzip docs:

PKZIP Usage: PKZIP (-b[path]) (options) zipfile (@list) (files..)

note the @list term.

let us assume we want to select files from the c:\ directory to 
be placed in a zip file named Zippy.Note that the special 
character @ is required to specify to pkzip which term is the
listfile name.This is the BLKOS2 command line specification.

<command/pgm name>  ]<special character >[<search pattern

EXAMPLE: pkzip -r -p -ex zippy ]@[c:*

choose from the select list and then press enter and the
command or pgm will be activated with the proper input list.

NOTE:even if the pgm does not require a special character
the ] is necessary to activate the list generate function.
Multiple terms on the command line can have unique lists.

example   doodad ]&[*.exe  /c /d  ]%[com   is entirely legal,
a list is generated for each selected terms and passed
to the command.

The list generator is usable at any time select alone or
in combination with attribute select(see below)  is appropriate.

NOTE: the file lists generated are not deleted to avoid  waiting while the delete occurs.
This is relatively unimporatnt as the lists are usually small in size and the file 
names are used repeatedly so they are always being cyled at each use. In any case
all of the list files are erased at boot.You can also wite an alias to delete these if they 
bother you.When blkos2 is made multithreaded using the RXU10 function package
this issue will disappear as the delete will be done in the background.

RECURSIVE SELECT WITHOUT ENTERING THE MENU:
when you know that you want to operate on all files(or dirs) in a particular place then
you can bypass the selector menu by using the following yet still have all those files
or directories  processed.
To process all files files matching the file spec in the  specified dirs and below
append  [[ to the end of the file spec.To process all dirs matching the spec and below 
append \[[ to the end of the dir spec.

EXAMPLE: we want to erase all *.exe files from c:\os2  and all sub dirs immediately 
without the pick list.
type del [c:os2\*.exe[[

EXAMPLE: we want to view the dir list for all dirs in c:\os2.NOTE:we can do this directly
with dir  /s but this illustrates how \[[ functions and is used with pgms that don't
have /s switches ie that don't recurse into sub dirs.

dir [:os2\[[

AN IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT LONG FILE NAMES:
Blkos2 will handle long file names in all operations except  as a search critria.
That is,     -> copy ["i want a bug fixer"                   is ILLEGAL.

This is relatively unimportant for  searching  since generally a
fragment of the first word will find the object.Once a long file name is found by the
selector it is wrapped in quotes and correctly passed to the command line.
Long file names in quotes on the cl that are not part of a select term are treated
as a single word and are always correctly passed to a command. IT IS ALSO POSSIBLE
to use the ? WILDCARD IN PLACE OF SPACES AND THE SELECT FUNCTION CAN 
THEN BE USED IN THE NORMAL WAY.

thus copy [i?want?a?bug?        is LEGAL->note: no quotes.


THE ATTRIBUTE FUNCTIONS:

TERMINOLOGY: ATTRIBUTE as used herein refers to any of these
file characteristics:date, time; file attributes(archive, readonly, hidden,
directory, system) and the file size.

The ATTRIBUTE SELECTOR is a filter function that lets you easily 
specify selection criteria of the above attributes in the select list.
Files which match the selection criteria are displayed in the select list.
It is like a bandpass filter where the upper and lower limits are 
independently settable , and there is additionally an equality function 
and a band reject function.

FORMAT OF THE DISPLAYED INFO: when in the attribute mode the 
time date field of the select list is in sorting format as follows
93/04/01/13/10     which corresponds to
year(last 2 digits)/month/day/hour(24hour format)/minute.

FORMAT OF THE INPUT INFO:

DATES are input as 930401 (6digits)  corresponding in this
case to April 1,1993
TIMES are input as 2110 (4 digits)  coressponding to  9:10 PM
or 0820 corresponding to 8:20 AM
SIZES are 7 digit decimal numbers
FILE ATTRIBUTES:the letters a,d,h,r,s for archive,directory,hidden,
readonly,system respectively.


SELECTING WITH ATTRIBUTE SPECIFICATION:
type your command line using any select terms as usual.Instead 
of hitting Enter, press CTRL and F1 simultaneously. The following 
menu appears:


                            SEARCH PATTERN co

IMMEDIATELY hit tab to bring the cursor to the first date field or shift tab to 
start at the attributes field

KEY CONTROL:
TAB:moves forward through the menu
Shift-TAB: moves backwards through the menu
delete, <-, ->, backdelete are all active.

You activate a search criteria by placing an entry in the 
appropriate field using  the above described date time size attribute formats.

1)entries in the low fields activate the greater/later than function.
2)entries in the high field activate the less/earlier than function.
3)entries in both fields activate the range("bandpass") function.
4)an entry in the low field followed by an '=' activates the equal function.
5)Entries in both high and low fields with the low field entry suffixed by
an uncapitalized 'i' activates the 'EVERYTHING BUT'("band reject"){i for inverse}
function.
6)activate the "strict earlier than" function by inputting a low date suffixed by an 'e'
and a low time. see below for definition of this function.
7)activate the "strict later than " function by inputting a low date suffixed by an 'l'(ell)
and a low date. see below.
8)File attributes:attributes are input as a single string of letters
such as "adh".
searches on this criteria come in 2 varieties.Inputting
any , singly or in combination, of  a,d,h,r,s activates a 
search for files with at least that attribute/attribute combination.suffixing the string with 
a  '/m' initiates  the MATCH attribute function-ONLY files with
EXACTLY those attributes are displayed.

EXAMPLE: we want to find all .exe files on drive C created
between 01/01/93 and 04/01/93, and between the hours of 
3PM and 9PM having a size of less than 500k and having  only the readonly
file attribute(match).

Start this search by typing [c:*.exe and hit CTRL-F1.Hit tab and fill in the
input list as follows:

        SEARCH PATTERN *.exe     <<-- note: this line only displays the search pattern-no
                                                                  input here.

press enter to start the search and the select list will appear in a few
seconds.

A NOTE ABOUT THE ENDPOINTS:in the range select the relations are
greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to.The 'everything but'
function is a simple logical inversion of those functions and thus the 
endpoints are not included(ie the = is lost).

IMPORTANT NOTE: specifying a low date and a low time alone does NOT give
you a pure "later than" function such as all files created after 
4pm ,04/10/93, Rather, it gives all files created on this and all subsequent days
which were made later than the hour 4PM on each of 
those days.Use the strict later/earlier than functions to perform this type
of  search.(see above)


INITIATING TERM BY TERM F11 TYPE SEARCHES: as mentioned above,
if you press f11 without entering the attribute function then ALL selects
on the Command line use the F11 style search. To choose  F11 searches for
specific terms enter the attribute selector after composing the command 
line(press CTRL-F1 instead of Enter),press f11 for terms you want the f11 search
for while at the attribute menu for that term and hit enter-do this also if you enter
attribute criteria.

NOTE: you can always move on from the attribute input list menu
by presing enter even if no fields have been filled-this will then result
in a normal non attribute selector function, with f11 type search if it was 
pressed for that term.


WORKPLACE SHELL FROM THE COMMAND LINE:


ALT-ENTER-- from either selector or command line will open a 
WPS folder filelist( FULL PATH ON CL IS NECESSARY ) or start a PGM OBJECT.
to use from cl-input path of folder or pgm (including extension
for pgms to start) and hit ALT ENTER.THE window will not come to the
foreground if an exe-program objects are started minimized.
-chose from os2 tasklist.Note there is nothing we can do about this-it is
a characteristic of the rexxutil function used to start the object.
Append a SPACE and an s (uncapitalized)
TO THE DIR/FILESPEC to open the settings view(the book) for the
selected objects.You can open as many file lists or setting views at 
one time as you desire.

EXAMPLE:   f:\os s  hit ALT- ENTER  opens os2 settings view
EXAMPLE:  [*.exe    select and hit alt- enter starts the chosen pgm(s)
EXAMPLE:  [c:os     and select opens the wps filelist for C:\OS2
you can also press alt enter first and then enter alone after selecting
for the same effect.Multiple selections to start pgms or open folders
can be made from the selector pick list.Tag all items you want opened
and hit alt-enter.
EXAMPLE: <objid> and alt enter starts object objid.NOTE: THE OBJECT
ID MUST BE SURROUNDED BY BRACKETS AS SHOWN;OBJECT IDs
ARE ALSO CASE SENSITIVE.
EXAMPLE: <WP_START>       and alt enter opens the startup folder
EXAMPLE <WP_START>  s     and alt enter opens the startup folder
settings view.


CURSOR FUNCTIONS 
 generally standard except that SHIFT-TAB is a
true back tab of 8 spaces-tabs do not insert spaces.
generally the cursor movement keys are congruent with the OS2
command line cursor movement/ editing keys and the 4OS2 key 
 functions with minor diffrerences in the ctrl key usage as below.

ALT-INS switches the type mode until the next time alt ins is issued.
Used to go from insert to overstrike or vice versa

CURSOR MOVEMENT AND EDITING KEYS:

ctrl ->:  move right one word
ctrl <-:  move left one word
ctrl home: letters on CL from beginning to cursor position are deleted
ctrl end: letters on command line from cursor position to end are deleted
alt <-: deletes  previous word -4os2 style
alt->:  deletes next word -4os2 style
all other keys(arrows,home, end, page up,page down,delete,backspace)
are standard


HISTORY FUNCTIONS:
The computer will beep when the latest entry in the history list is brought to the
command line-this way you know that you have cycled through the entire history list.

PAGE UP  at the command line brings up the history list.The list is set
for 1000 LINES.Actually you can set it to ANY size you want.
scroll and select as in the selector.NOTE: in general all
windows in BLKOS2 will function the same way and use the same keys.
UP ARROW from the command line recalls the history directly to 
the command line without displaying the history list box..

placing a letter or two on the CL and calling history will
list only those commands that match the typed pattern;This works for
both the UP ARROW  and PAGE UP keys.The commands are listed in
LIFO order.

ESC key exits most functions.

**************MISC FUNCTION KEYS:******************

QUICKLY SWITCHING DIRECTORIES AND THE DIRECTORY "STACK":

Actually it's not a stack so much as a history list of dirs.
To go immediately from directory A to directory B and have dir A placed in the
directory history for immediate recall type B's  full  path on the command line
and hit CTRL and-DOWN ARROW) simultaneously.You will immediately be in B
and dir A will be in the DIR HISTORY list.To recall a directory(ie move back to it)
you hit CTRL and UP ARROW ONCE.To see subsequent directories in the history  list
you continue hitting the up arrow alone until you reach the dir you want and then hit enter
to go there, or escape to abort. NOTE: you MUST hit ALT- right arrow to get a dir into
the history list -they are never placed there automatically.


ENTER-- initiates action on file/pgm higlighted in select list or starts a
highlighted exe or initiates a command line action.

CTRL-ENTER-allows a statement on the CL to be interpreted as an
os2 command rather than an alias of the same name(key)
EXAMPLE: dir on cl followed by ctrl-enter gives  an os2 dir  listing rather
than eg activating an alias named 'dir'.


CTRL-TAB ---QUICK FILENAME COMPLETION:
hitting CTRL-TAB after a filespec fragment is typed will present in
sequence complete filespec matches to the pattern immediately to the
left of the cursor FROM THE CURRENT directory.Useful anywhere on the command line.
example: type dir o and hit CTRL- TAB to generate the line
DIR C:\OS2.
form of the filespec is the same as for selector, no [ are used.


CTRL-F2: switches the log to file function on or off.When set  on, all
commands from all blkos2 sessions are  logged to a file in the
pather\history directory named blk.log. The entries are in the folllowing
format:
<session id number> <time> <date> <command>

to find out what the session id is for a session type(while in that session)

say idd 

and hit ALT -`(the rexx interpret function). The number 
displayed is the session id
You can set the logging function default on or off by setting the
variable logon in the configure block  at the top of the
blkos2.cmd file to 1 or 0 respectively.It is recommended that 
you set this on and activate os2 undelete so that you can 
recover anything you might accidentally lose or until you 
are comfortable with the safety of BLKOS2.

GENERAL INFO:
file specs are in the form X:filename.ext- wildcards allowed.names are
completed by the select function .Generallythe  first \ is not used in blkos2 functions.
example: copy [c:os2\mdos\vcdrom.sys

see the sample master.als for parameter usage note  parameter index
is  +1 above what a % parm would be eg %1 would be x.2  so the first parameter
used is x.2



NOTE:ALIASES IN THIS SHELL CANNOT  BE CALLED BY OTHER 
PROGRAMS OR BATCH FILES, but they can refer to themselves.

USE OF SAMPLE ALIASES:
NOTE: ALIASES ARE CASE SENSITIVE.


t alias
ALARM.CMD is a simple chron program that will issue an alarm or
start a pgm  or issue a command at a set time--resolution of the 
timer is about +-20 seconds-this alias starts ALARM.CMD
t <time> < command> <parms>
example t 123800 start /c /b pkzip zip c:\os2\*.* starts zip process at
12:38:00 PM +-20 sec

SHOW alias ---lists the lines of an alias on the screen
show <alias key>
EXAMPLE show show

e alias
e ( [ )filename(fragment)>

starts epm to edit a(perhaps SELECTed) file

d alias
d <dir name fragment>
auto dir name complete qd.cmd
example d wi   to switche to \os2\mdos\winos2 directory 
DO NOT USE D.CMD WITH THE SELECTOR use CDD below.

refr  alias- to start online rexx reference

refc alias to start command reference

put alias
ALT-p- to write a comment to an object 's ea's- this will be seen in the
comment field in the object's settings book.Use GET.CMD  to
view the comments or look at them in the settings view notebook.
This function will be integrated into the selector list for easy use-
the comments will be viewable directly in the selector object listing.

rec(ursive) alias: works just like 4os2 global-command operateds on current directory
and all subs.
EXAMPLE: rec copy *.exe c:\exes  copies all *.exe files in the current dir and all sub dirs
to c:\exes.

cdd alias:
input a full path to the dir you want to switch to or use the selector
example
cdd c:\os2\mdos
cdd   [c:md and select as usual.

u5 alias:
usage U5 <zip path and name> or  U5{ [[ or [ }<zip spearch spec>   for the selector.

this is a quick 'n dirty facility for easily unarchiving all your archived dls to
quickly view or test/use the pgms therein. It handles arc , zip, arj,self extracting exe,and
lhz files from one facility and with one command line. all you enter is the archive file
path and name and U5 does the rest.the file is copied to a sub directory created in the
dir where the archive is located, the files are unarchived therein, an option to start a
dos session is presented-if you say no(type n) then the os2 session is available(blkos2
is started as the command proc) and a wps directory list is opened.When you have 
finished working with the archive type exit at the command line and hit enter .
the temporary dir and all files therein are removed and the wps folder list is closed.
Note that if you have a session set to the path of that temporary fiolder then the
folder itself will not be removed.The folder is named the same as the archive file minus
it's extension.

this alias must have  dd.cmd  and the archivers available to it(place the archivers in 
your path-use os2 versions where available such as info zip for pkzip). You need to 
 edit U5.CMD so that the dearchiver's names match those on YOUR system.
lines with /?******?/ denote those you must edit-make sure the command line is 
appropriate for  the archiver versions you are using.

U5.CMD can also be used stand alone in the WPS as a drag and drop dearchiver.
attach an icon and just drop an archive on it to unarchive as above-a commandline
 session is automatically started.

NOTE ON DD.CMD AND U5: there is apparently a bug in os2 that sometimes causes a
dir to be non deleteable.Check that you have no sessions pointing to this undeleteable
folder-if you do then it is probably not the os2 bug stopping you. If there are no
such sessions then the dir will be removable on the next reboot- just use dd.cmd 
to get rid of it. We know this is an OS2 bug because not even  RD will delete such
a "stuck" folder.

lst    ([)<file spec>
display a (perhaps selected) text or binary file on the screen.hit  x to exit, and  u
to move to previous page, any other key to go to the next page.

cl    <no parameters>
You must have  KILLEM.EXE in your path-this cmd closes ALL open sessions of 
any type.

alt-z: this alias opens a desktop folder or standard OS2 object without having to 
capitalize or bracket the object id or type the WP_ prefix.Works on those os2 
objects with objid  of form <WP_START>
example: type start and hit alt-z to open the  <WP_START>(startup) folder.
type dalarm to start <WP_ALARM>. see the ini.rc file in  the  \os2 for the standard os2
object ids for the applets etc.

If the shell dies history and temporary aliases ARE SAVED for
each session and a restart reloads that session's history and temporary
 aliases.You may or may
not be able to issue a CTRL- C to a program or command to stop it
-doing it with zip will stop the zip process,trying to stop a dir 
command will kill the shell-in general .CMD files are stoppable.

ALL HISTORY AND TEMPORARY ALIASES ARE PERMANENTLY LOST 
ON A REBOOT.IF YOU WANT TO SAVE THESE THEN DO NOT MODIFY
YOUR STARTUP.CMD FILE AS INSTRUCTED ABOVE.

PLEASE PAY PARTICULAR ATTENTION TO MEMORY USAGE IN THE
SESSIONS WHERE BLKOS2 IS RUNNING>USE OS2MEMU-
we are interested in whether there is unreasonable growth in use of
memory.

SPECIAL NOTE: there is a bug in OS2 rexx that does not allow the release 
of memory committed to a so called stem variable.The drop function nor any other 
nulling operation will release this memory.For this reason the session may show 
a large memory usage after a global search. Until IBM fixes rexx the only thing to 
do to get the memory back is to shut and then restart the blkos2 session.This is 
the best that can be done without IBM fixing this bug in rexx .It affects all  OS2 REXX
pgms that never terminate or do so infrequently.BLKOS@ uses the same stem 
variables in it's operation and once maxed out will not get any larger in memory.
In any case use of BLKOS2 for most operations reults in memory usage generally 
under 500 KB.


PLEASE ROUTE (RECEIVER ONLY) ANY COMMENTS TO
CHARLENE BLACK at ->18 ON RIME (RELAYNET)

or contact us via US mail at the abocve address.

DEVELOPMENT IS CONTINUING AND ADDITIONAL FEATURES 
ARE PLANNED-Send suggestions for features-we'll
add them for you.planned additional features include global
history,multithreading using the rxu10 functions, the absolutely
essential colorized directories,sorting, a directory size calculator.
and others..BLKOS2 is used
by us on a daily basis and has been found to be very free of bugs 
thus far.

The object configurator will be sent later when it has been 
integrated into Blackstone.If you would like the current ,still very
useful  standalone pgm, send C>BLACK a note.

We hope that  this program makes life at the OS2 
command line simpler and more convenient for you.

Thank You for Testing BLACKSTONE.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTs: VERY SPECIAL THANKS to our BETA TESTERS
who shall for the time being go unnamed, for their support and suggestions.

Thanks to Ken Arway for the BLKOS2 icon design.
