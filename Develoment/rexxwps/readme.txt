This archive contains some REXX programs discussed in "REXX Report, Summer 1995"
(Miller & Freeman, September '95) entitled "The Workplace Shell:  Objects to the
Core", pp:  42-51.

Additionally, *all* figures (including tables for keyword/value pairs of the 
discussed WPS object classes).

Hope this helps some of you.
