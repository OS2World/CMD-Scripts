RxLogin version 1.0b2 - Brought to you by darkpoet productions, inc.
        ------------------------------------------------

RxLogin is a really simple way of securing your OS/2 machine - the program
is designed to simply keep prompting for a password until the correct one
is entered.

The program will not echo the characters typed - instead, one '*' is
displayed for each key pressed. The program will keep accepting letters
until the enter key is pressed, allowing for password strings that can be
as long as needed.

RxLogin can take one parameter - the password can be passed to it on the
command line. If there is no command line parameter, rxLogin will prompt
the user for one to use.

Usage:

  rxLogin [password]
    [password]          : optional text password

I would suggest installing this in your CONFIG.SYS with a line similar to:

    RUN=E:\BIN\rxLogin HELPME!

which would prevent boot-up from completing until the password (HELPME!) is
entered.  Just make sure you don't forget the password.  *grin*

Since Digital Productions is no longer supporting this program, I've taken it
upon myself to revamp the coding, add color, and maybe put in some more options
as time progresses.  This program is emailware.  All I ask if you use this, is
send me mail, stating how you use it, what you'd like to see added into it, or
something, just so I know what's happening with this program.  You can contact
me at darkpoet@bellsouth.net, and my web page/zine will be coming up soon, at
http://www.pcrealm.net/~darkpoet.
