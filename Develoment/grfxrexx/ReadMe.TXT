Here are five REXX programs designed to fetch information from graphics
files. I initially wrote them as a part of a program that documents the
FILES.BBS files of my BBS system (LoraBBS).

The procedures in these files could be packed together in a single
procedure that displays information about files in any of the five
formats.
The procedures do not rely on the extension to check whether the file in
in the proper format, but to the actual data from the file.

Any comments welcome :
