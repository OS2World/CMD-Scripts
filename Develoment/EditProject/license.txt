      -------------------------------------------------------------------


       IF YOU DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

       I grant you a license to use the Program only in the country where you
       acquired it.  The Program is copyrighted and licensed (not sold).  I do
       not transfer title to the Program to you.  You obtain no rights other than
       those granted you under this license.


       Under this license, you may:

       1. use the Program on one or more machines at a time;
       2. make copies of the Program for use or backup purposes within
          your Enterprise;
       3. make copies of the original file you downloaded and distribute
          it, provided that you transfer a copy of this license to the
          other party. The other party agrees to these terms by its
          first use of the Program.
       4. modify the source code provided that you change the name of the
          package source code files and give credit where credit is due.

       You must reproduce the copyright notice and any other legend of
       ownership on each copy or partial copy, of the Program.

       You may NOT:

       1. sublicense, rent, lease, or assign the Program;

       Under no circumstances am I liable for any of the following:

       1. third-party claims against you for losses or damages;
       2. loss of, or damage to, your records or data; or
       3. economic consequential damages (including lost profits or
          savings) or incidental damages, even if I are informed of
          their possibility.

       Some jurisdictions do not allow these limitations or exclusions,
       so they may not apply to you.

       I do not warrant uninterrupted or error free operation of the
       Program. I have no obligation to provide service, defect
       correction, or any maintenance for the Program. I have no
       obligation to supply any Program updates or enhancements to you
       even if such are or later become available.


       IF YOU DOWNLOAD OR USE THIS PROGRAM YOU AGREE TO THESE TERMS.

       THERE ARE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING THE
       IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
       PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

       Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied
       warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

       You may terminate this license at any time. I may terminate this
       license if you fail to comply with any of its terms. In either
       event, you must destroy all your copies of the Program.

       You are responsible for the payment of any taxes resulting from
       this license.

       You may not sell, transfer, assign, or subcontract any of your
       rights or obligations under this license. Any attempt to do so is
       void.

       Neither of us may bring a legal action more than two years after
       the cause of action arose.

       If you acquired the Program in the United States, this license is
       governed by the laws of the State of New York. If you acquired
       the Program in Canada, this license is governed by the laws of
       the Province of Ontario. Otherwise, this license is governed by
       the laws of the country in which you acquired the Program.
