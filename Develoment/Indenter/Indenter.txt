"Darkness on Harvey's World"


  Harvey's World seemed like a paradise, perfect for colonization.  Its
broad rolling grasslands were warmed by gentle breezes and blanketed
with docile herbivores.  But when the first small survey colony arrived
and started sending bizarre reports of unexplained darkness, then
abruptly stopped sending reports three days after landing, a rescue ship
was rushed to help.


  As the rescuers neared Harvey's World and began to receive
automated telemetry from the stricken ship, they learned that only four
of the twenty-four crew members were still alive . . .   barely.  The
survivors' medical telemetry made no sense, but their final log entries
made even less sense.


  What happened to the survey colony?  What was the darkness that
enveloped the sunny green paradise?  Can the rescue team save the
remaining survivors without succumbing to whatever caused the
disaster?  Harvey's World looked gorgeous and safe, an ideal colony
planet.  But something had destroyed the colony ship and crew within
three days.  The first rule of a space rescue is "Don't Die Trying."
