PUSHD version 2.1    Sept. 22, 1993

This package contains REXX programs for changing directories.
pushd, popd, and dirs are near-Unix (csh) equivalents.  "d" is
a replacement for cd (I wish OS/2 would allow aliases, so that
"cd" would call d.cmd.  I've heard that 4os2 has this behavior).

All the programs allow you to change drives as well as directories.
You can use the forward slash, '/', as well as the backslash, '\'.
For directory names with embedded spaces, use quotes around it.
The pushd,popd,dirs trio access a stack of directories as follows:

pushd pushes your current directory onto the stack and cd's to
the new directory.  If there is no argument, pushd exchanges
the top two entries of the stack (and cd's to the new top of
stack).  The +n option allows you to rotate the stack to the
nth entry (experiment to see how this works).  The top entry
in the stack (your current directory) is the 0th entry.

popd pops off the top directory, and cds to the new top of stack.
The +n option will delete the nth entry from the stack, without
changing directories.

dirs just shows you what the stack looks like.

Examples (C is FAT, D & E are HPFS):
    [E:\] pushd /tmp
    e:\tmp e:\

    [E:\tmp] pushd c:/dos
    c:\DOS e:\tmp e:\

    [C:\DOS] pushd
    e:\tmp c:\DOS e:\

    [E:\tmp] popd +1
    e:\tmp e:\

    [E:\tmp] pushd d:\os2\mdos
    d:\os2\mdos e:\tmp e:\

    [D:\os2\mdos] pushd
    e:\tmp d:\os2\mdos e:\

    [E:\tmp] pushd +2
    e:\ e:\tmp d:\os2\mdos

    [E:\] d apps

    [E:\apps] dirs
    e:\apps e:\tmp d:\os2\mdos

An environment variable called PUSHD is used to save the
directory stack.  This method allows you to maintain separate
directory stacks in each window.  This is considered a *feature*,
not a *bug*! :-).
