These REXX programs were written and tested by Ken Neighbors
(wkn@leland.stanford.edu), Greg Roelofs (roe2@midway.uchicago.edu)
and Ric Anderson (ric@cs.arizona.edu).

We release these programs to the public domain, but appreciate it
if you'd retain our names in any modified versions.  Of course,
we are not responsible for what may happen to your hard disk or
anything else if you use these programs (especially if they get
modified).  We've been using them without problems.

You may send bug reports to wkn@leland.stanford.edu, but don't
expect any immediate fixes.
