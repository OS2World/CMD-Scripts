KWHELP.NDX | is a more comprehensive NDX file to replace the supplied
-----------+ index file (EPMKWHLP.NDX).  This NDX file was generated
directly from the contents of the INF file in most cases.  It also includes
all structures and constants, plus SOM keywords, EPM commands and
procedures, IPF tags, DOS and REXX commands.  It does NOT replace
DDE4.NDX (CSet/2 index).

To enable, put KWHELP.NDX in a DPATH directory and change your HELPNDX
environment variable to reference it.  A typical setting might be:
   SET HELPNDX=DDE4.NDX+KWHELP.NDX

NOTE: This index file has not been tested with KWIKINF.


KWHELP.E | is a replacement for EPM's standard KWHELP.E, which provides
---------+ on-line programming keyword help via Ctrl+H or Ctrl+DblClick.
This replacement adds:
    * generic "h" command to allow looking up a topic in a book
    * list of available books generated from BOOKSHELF environment
    * filetype-sensitivity in the index search -- the "EXTENSIONS:"
      tags are not ignored.
    * index search will search for case-insensitive match if no exact
      match is found.

Requires the ETPM compiler, which is available on Compuserve and OS/2
BBS's.
