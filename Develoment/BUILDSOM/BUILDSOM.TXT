         INTRODUCTION
         ------------


         BuildSOM is a REXX program that will create OS/2 WPS objects.
         Currently, the program supports only program and folder objects.
         To build your WPS objects, create a file that contains the
         definitions for the objects and run BuildSOM against that file.
         The syntax is:

                     BuildSOM <defnfile>

         BuildSOM provides four primary value-added facilities over an
         equivalent REXX program.

         1)!!!!!!BuildSOM will automatically handle the nesting of objects
         within folders.  (For you SysCreateObject programmers, the location
         is derived).

         2)!!!!!!The code will verify the existence of program executables
         and the working directory for program objects before creating
         the WPS objects.  Additionally, those executables in the path
         do not have to be fully qualified.  BuildSOM will search the path
         to find the full pathname of the program.

         3)!!!!!!Since BuildSOM is a two-pass program, ALL folder and
         program objects are verified before any objects are created.  This
         makes cleanup a lot easier than debugging a series of REXX
         SysCreateObject calls.

         4)!!!!!!The defintions file is syntactically easier than a REXX
         program with the equivalent statements.



         DEFINTIONS FILE
         ---------------


         The defintions file is a series of statements that create a
         program or folder object.  The syntax is:

               CREATE { FOLDER | PROGRAM } ["Title"] [objectid]
                  BEGIN
                  [setup1]
                  [setup2]
                     .
                     .
                     .
                  END


         Note that the title must be enclosed in double quotes and connot
         contain any quotes.  The object ID is optional.  The setup is
         additional statements that define the executable file, the working
         directory, the icon, etc associated with the WPS object that is
         being created.  A list of those follow:

               ICON
               EXE
               PARM
               DIR
               SESSION

                 .
                 .
                 .

         Note that the BEGIN/END pair is required, even if there are no
         setup values.  I will improve the parser in subsequent versions
         to remove this restriction.

         The nesting of objects within a folder is handled by enclosing
         the defintions for contained objects in curly braces, much like
         a C program.  The following example creates a folder with a
         full screen OS/2 command session and a windowed OS/2 command
         session in it.

            CREATE FOLDER "Quick Command Lines"
               BEGIN
               END
               {
               CREATE PROGRAM "Windowed OS/2 Session"
                  BEGIN
                  EXE    *
                  DIR    C:\
                  SESS   OS2WINDOW
                  END
               CREATE PROGRAM "Full Screen OS/2 Session"
                  BEGIN
                  EXE    *
                  DIR    C:\
                  SESS   OS2FULLSCREEN
                  END
               }



         QUIRKS, THOUGHTS, ETC
         ---------------------

         The program assumes that the objects created are on the desktop
         or nested under the desktop.  There is no support in this
         release of starting the hierarchy in another folder.

         I have noticed that if the executable is specified as '*', you
         MUST have a SESS qualifier to make the object create complete.

         If you create an environment variable called 'ICONS' that contains
         a list of directories that contain icon files, then this code will
         search those directories to fully qualify the icon name.
