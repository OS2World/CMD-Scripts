GIF_INFO is an OS/2 REXX procedure that will extract information from a GIF file.
This information includes the height, width and color table information for
the "global" image as well as for each (of possibly several) images in 
an animated GIF file. GIF_INFO can also be used to extract comments, "application
blocks", and "plain text" blocks from GIF files.

GIF_INFO is freeware; with the usual "use at your own risk" disclaimer.
