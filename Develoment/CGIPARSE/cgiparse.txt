CGIParse
--------

This script is a REXX procedure that facilitates variable handling when writing
CGI programs in REXX. I will not elaborate much on it except how to use it. The
script has been in use for a long time on several sites I programmed, so it's
considered (by me) to be fairly bug free.

How to use
----------

CGIParse works transparently with both <FORM METHOD="post" ...> and
<FORM METHOD="get" ...>. Paste the REXX procedures in the 'CGIParse.cmd' file
into your own REXX CGI script, and put a call to 'CGIParse' somewhere in the
beginning of your script like this:

call CGIParse

This will extract all CGI variables into REXX variables whose name begins with
'cgi.'. Consider the folowing example, you have a form with the folowing input
field:

<INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="varname">

When the form is submitted and the CGIParse function is called the value of the
form variable 'varname' can be accessed through the REXX variable 'cgi.varname'

How does it work
----------------

Check out the REXX code yourself.
