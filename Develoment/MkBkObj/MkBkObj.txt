MkBkObj utility V0.21

(C) 1994-95 by Ralf G. R. Bergs <rabe@rwth-aachen.de>
Released as "Freeware"


This is a simple, but nevertheless quite useful REXX script that can
be used to create program objects for .INF and other documentation files
in a simple manner.

To use it, install it by starting the INSTALL.CMD script. When asked,
enter the destination directory (without leading backslash, e.g.
"g:\tools") and press return. This copies MkBkObj.CMD to the desti-
nation directory and creates a program object for it on your desktop.

Whenever you want to create a program object for one or several
.INF or other doc files, you just drag the files from your drives
object to the "Make Book Object" icon.
".INF" files get installed with VIEW.EXE as their viewer app, all
other files get E.EXE as viewer app.

This is released as "Freeware" in the hope that it may be useful.
However, no warranty whatsoever is given. If it kills your cat,
bad luck. :-)



Limitations:

- If an object with the same object ID as the to-be-created object
  already exists, MkBkObj will fail silently. I don't consider this
  to be a big problem, since it only happens very seldomly, but if
  you do think it's a problem for you, feel free to send me mail.
  Maybe I will re-consider adding a check for this to give the
  object a unique ID.



History:

0.21   03/16/95   simplify stem/ext parsing algorithm (thanks to
                    Paul Gallagher <paulg@resmel.bhp.com.au> for
                    suggesting this)

0.2    10/23/94   only load 'SysCreateObject' if not yet resident
                    (thanks to Jason B. Tiller
                    <jtiller@ringer.jpl.nasa.gov> for suggesting this)
                  use "lastpos" instead of "pos" to separate extension
                    (thanks to Jason B. Tiller
                    <jtiller@ringer.jpl.nasa.gov> for suggesting this)
                  use "substr" with a default argument (thanks to Jason
                    B. Tiller <jtiller@ringer.jpl.nasa.gov> for suggesting
                    this)

                  give usage notice if necessary
