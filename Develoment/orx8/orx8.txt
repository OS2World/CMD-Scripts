orx8.zip, 97-07-21

Contains Object Rexx utilities in the form of source code.

Documentation in the separate package "orx8doc.zip" which
contains two postscript files (part1.ps, part2.ps) documenting
the functions. These two papers were written for RexxLA (Rexx
Language Association, http://www.RexxLA.org) to be included in
the proceedings for the "8th International Rexx Symposium" which
took place in Heidelberg/Germany in April 1997.

Please post questions and discussion items in the Internet newsgroup
"comp.lang.rexx", which gets monitored by the author. Thanks.
