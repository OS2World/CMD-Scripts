About QUOTE
==========
This script helps you prepare text for inclusion as print statements in C/C++
or REXX programs.
It is a filter - it processes the text redircted to its standard input stream.
Output is written to standard output stream. So, use it like this:

    type filename.txt | quote rexx > out.cmd

to process filename.txt for use in a REXX script

Using QUOTE
==========
Getting help:     QUOTE /?

Usage:
       QUOTE type
Where:
 'type' is the type of quoting to perform, as follows:
 QUOTE C
    formats lines with printf statements
 QUOTE C++
    formats lines to print to cout iostream
 QUOTE REXX
    formats lines to print with 'Say' keyword
 QUOTE REXXF
    formats lines to print with 'LINEOUT' function

Example:

       [C:\]type readme | QUOTE c++
       cout << "                  OS/2 Warp Version 3" << endl;
       cout << "                         README" << endl;
       cout << "" << endl;
       cout << "" << endl;
       cout << "  Welcome to OS/2* Warp Version 3 (OS/2 Warp)." << endl;
       cout << "  This README contains the latest information available." << endl;
       cout << "  It also contains helpful hints found in our testing." << endl;
       cout << "" << endl;
       cout << "  The README is only one source of information provided" << endl;
       cout << "  with OS/2 Warp.  Greater detail can be found in:" << endl;
       cout << "" << endl;
       (etc...)
