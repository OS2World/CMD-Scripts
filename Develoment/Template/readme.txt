   Description

   TEMPLATE.CMD is a "runtime system" for REXX programs.
   You can use TEMPLATE.CMD as base sourcefile for your REXX programs.

   For further documentation see the leading comments in the file
   TEMPLATE.CMD.

   Also included in this package are the programs MAKECMD.CMD and
   MAKESRC.CMD.

   Use MAKECMD.CMD to update the 'runtime system' of your REXX
   programs based on a prior version of TEMPLATE.CMD.

   Use MAKESRC.CMD to extract the 'real code' of your REXX programs
   based on TEMPLATE v2+ to get a smaller version for backup purpose.
   You may use MAKECMD.CMD to add the 'runtime system' to the files
   created by MAKESRC.CMD again if it is neccessary.

   In other words:

   MAKESRC.CMD deletes the 'runtime system' from your REXX programs
   and MAKECMD.CMD adds or updates the 'runtime system' to your REXX
   programs.
