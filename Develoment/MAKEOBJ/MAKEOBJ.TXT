"Quick"-help :


This little batchfile is intended to easy creation of program-objects.

Just call the "install.cmd". You will be asked for an directory,
where the "MakeObj.cmd" will be copied or give the directory on the
commandline. The directory you specify must already exist, no errorchecking
will be taken. The default is \OS2 in the bootdrive.



After the installation, you can find the MakeObj in the OPEN"-menu
of every executable file (better : file-object). A filter is set for
the type EXE, CMD, COM, BAT.

What you can do now :
      Just open a driveobject,
      Mark some EXE's,
      Click on MakeObj in the OPEN-menu

What will happen :
      for every marked file a programobject will be
      created on the DeskTop.
      Values are set for the name and the workingdirectory.

And after that :
      You can easily move the new objects to any folder ...

      Or you can drag the object to 'Programm Installation' page of PC/2.
      You just have to change the objectID (the second line) from 
      'programmname' to '<programmname>'. Now you can start the object via
      PC/2.


Hope you find it nice, Ingo.
