These are 3 REXX samples for OS/2. I tried to demonstrate
a variety of features and functions so that someone new to the REXX
language can see enough to get an idea what its about. They should
run under the 1.2 EE version of REXX but I don't know if they work
for any other versions.

REXXRAND.CMD       Creates a set of random numbers and displays
                   in groups of 2. Extensive error checking for
                   parameters. Type REXXRAND <CR> for help.

REXXDIR.CMD        A REXX DIR assist. You give it the file name
                   and the number of lines you can display on your
                   terminal and it handles the scrolling. Type
                   REXXDIR <CR> for help.
                   ( Creates a file REXXDIR.TXT when it runs )


REXXBEEP.CMD       A REXX Music ( sound is more like it) program.
                   It reads a file and plays the notes in the file
                   on the speaker. Type REXXBEEP ? <CR> for help.
                   ( Uses REXXBEEP.MUS as a default infile )


REXX in OS/2 does create a tokenized version that it appends to
the file after the CTRL-Z ( EOF ) mark. This happens the first time
you run the program. If you make no changes, it runs the tokenized
version. If you copy or edit, the tokenized version is deleted.

Reading external files uses the SAA features. LINEIN for instance
replaced EXECIO on VM and READ on a real old version of REXX I have.
( If LINEIN isn't recognized, try READ)

As I get some more examples done I will pass them along. If you have
any suggestions for new commands send them thru the IBM board to
Bill DICKENSON

Thanks

P.S.
I did this without a manual. My IBM rep has promised me a manual
"REAL SOON NOW". When I get it I'll write some more ambitious stuff.
