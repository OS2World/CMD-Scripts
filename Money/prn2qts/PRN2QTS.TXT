PRN2QTS v1.2                                                      27-07-2010


Quick&dirty conversion of Metastock's *.PRN to PM$tock's *.QTS file format


Enter the symbol to be converted. Enter "RDSA" (without the quotes) to use
the sample data files.

Next, enter both the (theoretical) first and last trading days to be
included. To use the sample files, the first date can be "20090101",
and the last date to be included could be "20100726".


The sample files, 2009.PRN and 2010.PRN, may be deleted. PM$tock itself is
needed because PRN2QTS.CMD searches for PMSTOCK.INI in the same directory.
PM$tock can be found here:

   http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/money/pmst11.zip

The *.QTS file format is not documented there. PRN2QTS.CMD does not take  
much care about file management. It tries to add new symbols to the list
of stocks available in PM$tock. The stock quotes are not downloaded. For
Euronext Amsterdam or Euronext Brussels a Metastock *.PRN file generator
is:

   http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/pub/os2/apps/money/ms-*.zip (now: ms-20100630.zip)

All involved components should be considered as being unsupported, including
PRN2QTS.CMD itself.
