METEOR.CMD

Introduction
============

  METEOR is an OS/2 REXX arcade type game.  I realize that REXX is a poor
  language choice for arcade games, and this program is meant mostly as a
  novelty, but it's still kinda fun to play.

Disclaimers
===========

  METEOR is freeware.  Feel free to copy it, modify it, do whatever you
  want to it.  Please note, however, that I'm not responsible for any
  problems it might cause you or your PC.

Features
========
  * Digital sound effects. (if you have MMPM/2 installed)
  * The top ten high scoring games are saved as demos.
  * It's networkable. (sort of, run it from a mapped network drive and
    all the high score/demos will be shared among all users.  This
    allows you to compete and view each other's performances.)
  * Reasonably well structured code. (for you REXX programmers)
  * Colorful (ANSI character) graphics.
  * Fast, furious action even on slower PCs. (That's probably an exaggeration)

Program Usage
=============

  At the OS/2 command prompt, type: METEOR [/s]

      /s = disable digital sound

  You'll get an instruction/high score screen.  It's a good idea to read
  the instruction screen carefully before playing.  It's also a good
  idea to watch a demo first.

  Hints:
    * TAP the keys, don't hold them down.
    * Keep an eye on the info area on the left side of the screen.
    * Look ahead.
    * All the bonus objects (colored letters) are helpful.

Comments are Welcome

  Thanks for playing Meteor!
