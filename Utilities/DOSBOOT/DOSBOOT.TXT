DOSBoot v 0.1

What is DOSBoot?
----------------

DOSBoot is an answer to the "Single Applications Mode" found in
Windows95.  It extends the OS/2 Dual Boot feature slightly to
automate the running of DOS programs that don't like OS/2.

DOSBoot consists of two files:

   DOSBOOT.CMD       -     an OS/2 batch file which does the
                           work on the OS/2 side of things.
   OS2BOOT.BAT       -     a DOS batch file which does the
                           work on the DOS side of things. 

Using DOSBoot
-------------

In addition, you'll need to create AUTOEXEC.BAT/CONFIG.SYS pairs
in \OS2\SYSTEM for each program you want to run with DOSBoot. 
The filename extensions should be unique to each pair.  For
example, for Panzer General I have CONFIG.PZG and AUTOEXEC.PZG.

Your AUTOEXEC file should run the application, then run
OS2BOOT.BAT when it's finished to clean up and reboot OS/2.

To run a DOS app with DOSBoot, create a program object on your
desktop which runs DOSBOOT.CMD, passing the unique 3-character
identifier of the app you want as a parameter.  For example, to
run Panzer General, I have an object with the following
settings:

   File and Path Name:  C:\BIN\DOSBOOT.CMD
   Parameters: PZG

Here are my CONFIG.PZG and AUTOEXEC.PZG:

---CONFIG.PZG---
shell=c:\dos\command.com /P
device=c:\dosbin\himem.sys
device=c:\dosbin\mtmcdas.sys /D:MCD001

---AUTOEXEC.PZG---
@echo off
path=c:\dos;c:\dosbin
mscdex /D:MCD001
mouse
vmode 72HZ
cd\games\pg
call pg
\dosbin\os2boot

How it Works
------------

Take a look at the batch files.  It's pretty simple.  DOSBOOT
copies CONFIG.DOS and AUTOEXEC.DOS to CONFIG.NML and
AUTOEXEC.NML, then copies the appropriate CONFIG/AUTOEXEC pair
to CONFIG.DOS/AUTOEXEC.DOS.  Then it does a "BOOT /DOS".

OS2BOOT copies CONFIG.NML/AUTOEXEC.NML to \CONFIG.SYS and
\AUTOEXEC.BAT, then does a "BOOT /OS2".

It isn't a perfect solution, but it will do quite nicely till
Warp 2 next year.
