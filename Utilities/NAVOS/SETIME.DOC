INTRODUCTION
============

 setime is an OS/2 REXX Command File that will dial the Naval
 Observatory and set the system clock to the Naval Observatory time.

 setime is not precisely accurate in that it does not take into account
 the time lag from the communications thru program execution thru the
 setting of the system time.  However, it should set the system clock to
 within a second of Naval Observatory Time.

 This is the very first version of setime.  I've tested it on a US
 Robotics HST modem, only.  I suspect that there might be subtle
 differences in the Hayes AT command set for other modems and they
 might not respond the same as my modem.


DISCLAIMERS
===========

 setime is freeware.  Feel free to copy it, modify it, do whatever you
 wish to it.  Just don't hold me responsible for any problems it might
 cause you or you system.


PROGRAM EXECUTION
=================

 At the OS/2 command line type:

    setime <year> <offset> <PhoneNumber> <ComPort>"

            <year>        = 2 digit year (e.g. 1992 = 92)
            <offset>      = Hours that your local time differs from
                             Greenwich Mean Time. Eastern Daylight
                             Time = 4 (i.e. 12:00 noon GMT is 08:00 EDT)
            <PhoneNumber> = Phone Number of Naval Observatory
                             1-202-653-0351 is default
            <ComPort>     = ComPort where your modem is connected
                             COM1 is default

 If for some reason setime cannot connect, it will timeout after 45
 seconds.
