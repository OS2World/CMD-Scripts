GETOBJ v1.11

GETOBJ creates a list containing the data for all objects in a folder (and it's sub folder) for example 
your desktop folder. 
For each object the title, the class, the setup string and the location is shown.                

GETOBJ can also create a REXX program with SysCreateObject calls to recreate the objects.                                         

GETOBJ needs the DLL WPTOOLS.DLL. 


New in v1.11:
- new WPTOOLS.DLL necessary for WARP 4
  (from WPTOOLS19.DLL)
- bug corrections and a work around 
  for a bug in Object REXX
