Rexx program "PI2.CMD" written based on the "RxQProcStatus()" function of the
RXU.ZIP (YDBAUTIL) function package.

PI2 is a Rexx program which displays process status information (similar to
that which PSTAT.EXE displays).  It provides the ability to "filter" the
process display by executable name, PID and PPID (parent process-id).  It will
list processes, "children" modules (i.e. DLLs), "parent" modules (i.e. those
which directly use the module (e.g. EXEs).

Not all the features work properly yet (e.g. ANCESTORS).  PI2 was meant more
as a demo of how results from "RxQProcStatus()" might be used rather than a
full function program, although I have found it quite useful for displaying
a filtered list of running processes (when I only want to see info on one or
a few processes without wading through PSTAT output, or visually searching
through the PSPM2.EXE window for the name I'm after).

You could enhance PI2.CMD to display a process tree, like that in PSPM2 but
as text lines (exercise in recursion through PID<->PPID relationships, etc.).

For this version of PI2.CMD to work, you must download RXU.ZIP v1.5 from OS2DF1
Rexx/Other library (v1.4 will suffice, except for PARENT,CHILDREN,DEPENDENTS,
etc.)
