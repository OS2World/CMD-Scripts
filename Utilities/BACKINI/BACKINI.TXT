BACKINI.CMD is a small REXX program that makes backups of all the *.ini files
found in the C:\os2 directory.  You can easily modify it to use a different 
drive.  If your *.ini files are the normal locations this will back up the two
major ini files, os2.ini and os2sys.ini.

Backini.cmd is intended to be included in your startup folder.  To do this copy
the file to c:\os2.   Create a shadow of the backini.cmd file in the startup 
folder.

The program works by maintaining a copy of a dir *.ini of c:\os2 in a file named
ini.lst.  Each time the computer is started, the program runs, reads the ini.lst
file and creates a new one.  It compares the new one against the old one, and if 
there are any items in the new one that are not in the old one, or that show any
changes in the creation date or size, it creates backup(s).

The backups maintained are *.cur, a copy of the present ini file, *.bak a backup
of the previous version, and *.bk2 a backup of the version prior to the previous
one.

If the ini file is newly created, the program creates all the backup files (in this 
case these are all copies of the present one), and then will gradually "ripple"
changes through the backup layers.

Because the os2.ini and os2sys.ini file frequently change, you will find that
these get backed up most times the computer is run.

This is the first REXX program I have ever written, so it is wide open for 
improvement.

I have put a copyright on it, but you are free to use and modify the progam
if you make available for public use any general improvements that you make 
so all may benefit.
