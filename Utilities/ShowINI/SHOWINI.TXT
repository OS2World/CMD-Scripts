Infos on SHOWINI.CMD
====================

SHOWINI.CMD allows you to 

      - interactively edit & print OS/2-INI-files and
      - to backup/restore/update OS/2-INI-files to/from INI- or TEXT-formats


1) Working interactively with OS/2-INI-files
============================================

SHOWINI.CMD allows you to interactively
 
    a) view
    b) print to text-(ASCII)-file
    c) edit
    d) move/copy
    e) delete
    f) configure SHOWINI.CMD

Toplevel entries ("Application entries") and key-entries in OS/2-INI-files. Just
enter:

     showini

Initially you will **not** see the menu choices for editing, moving/copying and
deleting INI-entries for safety reasons. In addition there is an option to log 
backup/update/restore operations; if you set this option to no an existing 
logfile will be erased (it has a name of "SHOWINI.LOG" and resides in the same 
directory as SHOWINI.CMD itself).

Also, you will get a choice to work with OS2.INI (USER) and OS2SYS.INI (SYSTEM).  
With "s" for scan you can have SHOWINI.CMD to automatically scan for valid 
OS/2-INI-files on all local and/or remote drives or a specific drive, it will 
successfully ignore Winodows-INI-files.  

Once you configure one of the above manipulative functions the configuration 
choice will be shown, if you reset them, it will not be shown anymore.  
Therefore you could safely leave this program on a machine for end-users.

In order to activate the edit, move/copy and/or delete functions, you need to 
enter "c" (configure) on the main menu.  This option will allways be accessible 
from the INI- and TopLevel-menus, no matter whether it is displayed or not.  All 
these settings will be stored in OS2.INI under the TopLevel-entry called "RGF 
Showini.cmd".  Hint:  If there are many entries in an INI-file, use the 
MODE-command to get more lines or more columns and/or lines:

       e.g. "MODE co80,100" for 100 lines or
            "MODE co132,50" for 132 columns and 50 lines on an XGA-adapter

Hint: Wherever it is possible from the program logic, you may immeditiately end 
SHOWINI.CMD by typing "q" (quit). Attention: if quitting the program, changes to
the settings are not stored in OS2.INI.


2) Batchfile-commands
=====================

SHOWINI.CMD allows for

        backing up and ***restoring*** INI-files while the system is running ! 

This means that you can backup even OS2.INI and OS2SYS.INI while the system is 
up and restore them from a backup while the system is running. SHOWINI.CMD 
by default produces **10-generation** backups.


a) syntax:
----------

   showini /switch[generations]  {filename | /modifier}  

       switch:    B[T]   ... make a BACKUP of an OS/2-INI-file
                  U[T]   ... UPDATE original OS/2-INI using a backup
                  R[T]   ... RESTORE original OS/2-INI using a backup, i.e. 
                             delete keys not found in backup
                    T    ... backup is a text-file (i.e. ASCII-file), else 
                             backup is a valid OS/2-INI-file

       generations: an optional number between 1-10, indicating how many
                    backup-files you want, respectively, which backup you 
                    wish to use; please note: backups will be numbered from
                    0 (= 1. generation) thru 9 (= 10. generation), e.g. 
                    ".IN0", ".TX9"

       filename: filename of OS/2-INI-file or the filename of the backup
       --- or ---
       modifier: 
                look for all OS/2-INI-files on the filesystem[s]:

                 L[OCAL]  ... only LOCAL filesystems are scanned
                 R[EMOTE] ... only REMOTE filesystems are scanned
                 A[LL] ...... both, LOCAL and REMOTE filesystems are scanned
                 D[RIVES]:letters ... only the given driveletters are scanned,
                                      where letters is e.g. ACDEH

                 process OS/2-system INI-files:

                 S[YSTEM] ... "OS2SYS.INI" affected only
                 U[SER] ..... "OS2.INI" afftected only
                 B[OTH] ..... both, "OS2SYS.INI" and "OS2.INI" affected



b) examples (pertaining to single files):
-----------------------------------------

   showini /b d:\os2\os2.ini
        ... make a backup of OS2.INI, resulting backup will be in an 
            OS/2-INI-format ("/B") and will have an extension of ".IN0", 
            ".IN1", ".IN2", ".IN3", ".IN4", ".IN5", ".IN6", ".IN7", ".IN8",
            ".IN9" depending on how many backups exist already.

   showini /bt4 e:\os2\os2sys.ini
        ... make a backup of OS2SYS.INI, resulting backup will be in a
            TEXT-format ("/BT", i.e. ASCII, editable by any text-editor) and 
            will have an extension of ".TX0", ".TX1", ".TX2", ".TX3", depending
            on how many backups exist already.

            Note: There are four generations desired ("/BT4") only. In case
                  there are more generations present, because beforehand you
                  used the default of 10 generations, all superfluos backups
                  will be deleted (oldest first) !

   showini /u c:\mamma_mia\mutter.in9
        ... update "mutter.ini" according to the backup-values in "mutter.in9" 
            which is in an OS/2-INI-format ("/U"). 

            Note: If "mutter.ini" does not exist, SHOWINI.CMD prompts the user
                  whether to create it !

   showini /rt q:vater.tx5
        ... restore "vater.ini" according to the backup-values in "vater.tx5"
            which is in TEXT-format ("/RT", i.e. ASCII-format, editable by 
            any text-editor).

            Note: The "restore"-operation deletes all Toplevels and Keys in the 
                  original OS/2-INI-file, which are not found in the backup. If 
                  you do not want to delete those entries, use the "update"-mode
                  instead !

            Note: If "vater.ini" does not exist, SHOWINI.CMD prompts the user
                  whether to create it !

            Note: If the name of the original OS/2-INI-file in the backup 
                  "vater.tx5" is another name like "father.ini", SHOWINI.CMD 
                  will work on that INI-file.

The switches B, U, R pertain to OS/2-INI-backup-files, BT, UT, RT to 
TEXT-backup-files.



c) examples (pertaining to filesystems, or OS2.INI, OS2SYS.INI):
----------------------------------------------------------------

   showini /b /local
   --- same as:
   showini /b /l

        ... make a backup of all OS/2 INI-files on all local drives, resulting
            backups will be in an OS/2-INI-format ("/B") and will have an
            extension of ".IN0", ".IN1", ".IN2", ".IN3", ".IN4", ".IN5", 
            ".IN6", ".IN7", ".IN8", ".IN9" depending on how many backups exist
            already.

   showini /b5 /local
   --- same as:
   showini /b5 /l

        ... make a backup of all OS/2 INI-files on all local drives, resulting
            backups will be in an OS/2-INI-format ("/B") and will have an
            extension of ".IN0", ".IN1", ".IN2", ".IN3", ".IN4", depending on
            how many backups exist already.

            Note: There are five generations desired ("/BT5") only. In case
                  there are more generations present, because beforehand you
                  used the default of 10 generations, all superfluos backups
                  will be deleted (oldest first) !

   showini /bt /local
   --- same as:
   showini /bt /l

        ... make a backup of all OS/2 INI-files on all local drives, resulting
            backups will be in TEXT-format ("/BT") and will have an
            extension of ".TX0", ".TX1", ".TX2", ".TX3", ".TX4", ".TX5", 
            ".TX6", ".TX7", ".TX8", ".TX9" depending on how many backups exist
            already.

   showini /b /remote
   --- same as:
   showini /b /r

        ... make a backup of all OS/2 INI-files on all remote drives, resulting
            backups will be in an OS/2-INI-format ("/B") and will have an
            extension of ".IN0", ".IN1", ".IN2", ".IN3", ".IN4", ".IN5", 
            ".IN6", ".IN7", ".IN8", ".IN9" depending on how many backups exist
            already.

   --- same as:
   showini /bt1 /a

        ... make a backup of all OS/2 INI-files on all drives, local and remote,
            resulting backups will be in TEXT-format ("/BT") and will have an
            extension of ".TX0".

            Note: There is one generation desired ("/BT1") only. In case there
                  are more generations present, because beforehand you used more
                  than one generation, all superfluos backups will be deleted
                  (oldest first) !

   showini /b /drives:adf
   --- same as:
   showini /b /d:adf

        ... make a backup of all OS/2 INI-files on drives "A", "D", "F",
            resulting backups will be in an OS/2-INI-format ("/B") and will have
            an extension of ".IN0", ".IN1", ".IN2", ".IN3", ".IN4", ".IN5",
            ".IN6", ".IN7", ".IN8", ".IN9" depending on how many backups exist
            already.


    showini /u /a

        ... update all OS/2-INI-files found on all drives, remote and local, 
            with backups in OS/2-INI-format. 

            Note: The latest backup will be used for updating the original 
                  OS/2-INI-files.

    showini /ut5 /a

        ... update all OS/2-INI-files found on all drives, remote and local, 
            with backups in TEXT-format. SHOWINI.CMD uses the 5th backup
            (i.e. extension ".TX4"), if not found any backup which is before the
            5th.


    showini /r /a

        ... update all OS/2-INI-files found on all drives, remote and local, 
            with backups in OS/2-INI-format.

            Note: The "restore"-operation deletes all Toplevels and Keys in the 
                  original OS/2-INI-file, which are not found in the backup. If 
                  you do not want to delete those entries, use the "update"-mode
                  instead !

            Note: The latest backup will be used for updating the original 
                  OS/2-INI-files.


   showini /b /user
   --- same as:
   showini /b /u

        ... backup "OS2.INI".

   showini /rt4 /system
   --- same as:
   showini /rt4 /s

        ... restore "OS2SYS.INI" from a TEXT-backup. Use the fourth, if not 
            found a younger, generation.

   showini /ut /both
   --- same as:
   showini /ut /b

        ... update both, "OS2.INI" and "OS2SYS.INI", with the latest 
            TEXT-backup.

3) EXIT-codes
=============

 0 ... everything went o.k.
-1 ... user aborted program
-2 ... wrong switch or invalid filename
-3 ... invalid backup-file


4) minimal layout of text-(ASCII)-backup-files
==============================================

        ; a line starting with a semi-column is a comment and is ignored
        ; blank lines are ignored as well

        ; the file entry must be included and be given before the TopLevel- and
        ; key-entries; it may span multiple lines (for long filenames) and has
        ; the principal layout
        ;
        ;          "File [file name]"
        ; delimiter for the value is allways an opening and ending square 
        ; bracket

        File  [D:\work\klondike.ini] 
        
        ; A TopLevel (application) entry starts with the keyword "Top"; is being
        ; followed by the datatype [A], [A0] or [H] for ASCII, ASCII-Z, resp.
        ; hexadecimal; the last entry is the value enclosed in square brackets.
        ; 
        ; The same syntax applies to the key-names ("Key") and finally to the
        ; values themselves ("Val").
        ;
        ; Any Value for TopLevel-names, Key-names and Key-values may span 
        ; multiple lines; if so, subsequent lines must not contain a key-word,
        ; but the data-type and the value.


        Top [A]  [PATIENCE]
            Key  [A]  [CardBack]

        ; the key-value is of ASCII-string, terminated by \0; note that the 
        ; terminating '00'x is not contained within the value part:

                 Val  [A0] [2]

        ; the following key-value spans two lines:

            Key  [A]  [ColorSet]
                 Val  [A0] [13]
                      [A0] [03]
        
        ; this is an example for hexadecimal values for all three, 
        ;TopLevel-name, key-name and key-value:

        Top [H]  [01020304050607]
            Key  [H]  [08091011]
                 Val  [H]  [12131415]

        ; note values enclosed in the square-bracket-delimiters may contain
        ; square brackets themselves:

        Top [A]  [This is another TopLevel-entry [yes, another]]
            Key  [A]  [This is another key-entry]
                 Val  [A]  [This is a plain ASCII-entry.]
            Key  [A]  [This is the second key-entry, within this TopLevel.]
                 Val  [A0] [This is an ASCII-Z entry.]

For further examples of the syntax of the text-(ASCII)-file see any printout or
text-(ASCII)-backup.
        

CONCLUDING remarks
==================

Be patiened if you are running SHOWINI.CMD in batch-mode. All update- and 
insert-operations on OS/2-INI-files are ***extremely*** slow ! Hopefully this 
behaviour will be improved in a later release (actual release level OS/2 2.00). 
For the release level 2.0 beware of using SHOWINI.CMD without applying the CSD 
for REXX from IBM (e.g. found on hobbes, Compuserve etc.).
