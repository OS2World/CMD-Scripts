Two OS/2 REXX files that:

SHOWINI.CMD allows you to 
 - interactively edit & print OS/2-INI-files
 - to backup/restore/update OS/2-INI-files
   to/from INI- or TEXT-formats
BOXEDIT.CMD
 - Allows editing text in an
   ASCII-OS2-window.

If nothing else, they show the power of the
REXX language and can serve as an example of
complex REXX programming.
