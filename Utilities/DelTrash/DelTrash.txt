DelTrash User's Guide v0.2				      27 Nov 03
===========================

DelTrash does a more or less controlled delete of the MR/2 ICE Trash 
folders.

Unlike the built-in MR/2 ICE code, DelTrash can process all user profiles in 
a single run.

DelTrash is safe to run when MR/2 ICE is active because MR/2 ICE rebuilds 
the Trash folder index each time the folder is opened.

It is recommended, but not required, that the Trash folder for the current 
profile be closed when running DelTrash.

Installation
============

The preferred install location is the MR/2 ICE Scripts subdirectory, but the 
script may be installed elsewhere as long as you don't get too creative.  The 
script makes a best efforts search for your MR/2 ICE installation.


Usage
=====

To run DelTrash in default mode, run it with no switches or arguments.  It 
will find the profile accounts and delete the eligible files.

There are several optional command line switches available.  Switches are 
unix style and begin with a dash (-) and are case-sensitive.  Slashes (/) 
will not work.  The switches are:

  -d	Debug messages
  -h	Display usage help.
  -t	Run in test mode.  Find and display files eligible for delete but
	delete nothing.
  -v    Verbose messages 
  -V	Display version info and exit.

You can select which profile accounts to process by listing them on the 
command line after any switches.  For example:

  DelTrash Mail eCS

will process only the Mail and eCS accounts.  The default action is to 
process all profile accounts.

You can override the default 3 day cutoff by on the command line by entering 
a numeric value after any switches.  For example:

  DelTrash 5

will set the cutoff to 5.

The file date definition used to by DelTrash is somewhat different than 
that used by MR/2 ICE.  MR/2 ICE encodes the date the message was moved to 
the Trash folder in the file extension.  DelTrash uses the actual filesystem 
date.  If you move a very old messages to the Trash folder, DelTrash will 
delete them from the Trash folder sooner than the built-in MR/2 ICE delete 
logic.

To run against all profile accounts with no prompting and the default 3 day 
cutoff, use:

  DelTrash

To see what the above would delete, use:

  DelTrash -t
