What WHICHDLL does
------------------
Enter 'WHICHDLL -H' for more infos.

WHICHDLL is a Rexx script that searches the LIBPATH variable for the specified DLL file to determine which DLL is actually found first. WHICHDLL works like the WHICH utility (available for OS/2 as Gnuware) that searches the PATH variable for an executable file.

Since LIBPATH is not a true environment variable, there is a small problem to read it from a Classic Rexx program. WHICHDLL instead reads your CONFIG.SYS to find LIBPATH. If C is not your boot drive, you will need to specify the boot drive using the "-B" command line option. See "WHICHDLL -H" for further infos.
