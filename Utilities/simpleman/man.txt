SIMPLIFIED MAN
  V1.0

  Simplified MAN is a command-line viewer for Unix-style manual (man) pages,
  based on the standard Unix 'man' command.  It tries to be easy to install and
  use, and emphasizes convenience over precisely duplicating man's behaviour.
  Consequently, it does not implement some of man's more advanced features.


WHY A SIMPLIFIED MAN?

  OS/2 binaries of GNU man are available from various sources.  But they
  typically require you to have an extensive Unix-like environment set up.

  At a minimum, GNU man generally requires you to have gawk, sh, sed and groff
  installed and working (as well as the ubiquitous EMX).  Some of these programs
  are a major nuisance to install and configure.

  By contast, Simplified MAN has considerably fewer prerequisites, all of which
  are fairly simple to install.


PREREQUISITES

  * OS/2 with REXX support (obviously).

  * The Cawf utility (installed somewhere on the PATH).  Cawf is available
    on Hobbes:

    http://hobbes.nmsu.edu/cgi-bin/h-viewer?sh=1&fname=/pub/os2/apps/wp/cawf410.zip

    Cawf is a text formatter that implements a commonly-used subset of nroff
    functionality.  It is much smaller (by several factors) and easier to set
    up than GNU groff.

    Explanation:

      Unix-style man pages normally use a layout encoding that requires a troff-
      like formatter (groff or nroff) to translate them into readable output.
      GNU man depends on groff to do this.  However, groff is a huge software
      package which can be very difficult get working under OS/2 (personally,
      I've never managed it).  Cawf concentrates on implementing a useful subset
      of nroff's capabilities; in my experience it's about 99% compatible with
      man pages.  Consequently, it's a lot smaller and much, much easier to get
      working.

    Note that there's nothing in Simplified MAN that absolutely requires Cawf
    instead of groff.  You can easily configure it to use groff (or any other
    nroff/troff-compatible program) by editing MAN.CMD and changing the variable
    'troffcmd' near the top of the file.

  * The 'less' pager is recommended.  You can obtain this from Hobbes, or from
    UnixOS2: http://www.unixos2.org/pub/unixos2/packages/

    If you don't have (and don't want) less, you can use OS/2's built-in 'more'
    pager instead.  Simply define the environment variable PAGER as follows:

        SET PAGER=MORE

    Note that 'more' is considerably less functional than 'less' (it doesn't
    support backwards paging or searching, for instance).

    If you have another pager you prefer to use, you can of course substitute
    that instead.  See under ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES, below, for more information.

  * If you want to be able to view compressed man pages, you must also have GNU
    gzip installed on your PATH.  It is available from the same sites as less
    (see above).



INSTALLATION & USAGE

  Simplified MAN consists of one file, MAN.CMD (a REXX script).  Simply place
  this on your PATH, make sure Cawf is installed, and you should be ready to go.

  You may want to set a MANPATH environment variable, but this is optional.
  (Unix man expects all man pages to live under a directory on the MANPATH.
  I've added the ability to view a man page in the current directory, or one
  given as a literal filespec.)  See 'MANPATH' under ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES,
  below.

  The syntax is extremely simple:

      man <manpage>

  where <manpage> is either the literal name of a man page file, or is the name
  of a command whose man page is installed in the MANPATH or in the current
  working directory.

  Simplified MAN does not support the section parameter.  To view man pages from
  a specific section (in the event that identically-named man pages exist in
  multiple sections), you will have to specify the numeric extension.  For
  example, if you have both samba.1 and samba.5, running 'man samba' will
  display samba.1; to display samba.5, you must run 'man samba.5' instead.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

  Simplified MAN makes use of the following environment variables, if defined.
  They are all optional.


  MANPATH

    %MANPATH% is a PATH-like environment variable, consisting of one or more
    directory names separated by semicolons.

    If the parameter passed to MAN.CMD cannot be resolved to a literal filespec,
    Simplified MAN will search for it according to the following logic:

      - [current]\[manpage].[n]
      - [current]\[manpage].[n].gz
      - [MANPATH]\man[n]\[manpage].[n]
      - [MANPATH]\man[n]\[manpage].[n].gz
      - [MANPATH]\man[n]\[manpage].gz
      - [MANPATH]\man[n]\[manpage].man
      - [MANPATH]\man[n]\[manpage]
      - [MANPATH]\[manpage].[n]
      - [MANPATH]\[manpage].[n].gz
      - [MANPATH]\[manpage].gz
      - [MANPATH]\[manpage].man
      - [MANPATH]\[manpage]

    Where [current] is the current directory when MAN.CMD was invoked; [MANPATH]
    is every directory in %MANPATH%, in order; [manpage] is the parameter passed
    to MAN.CMD; and [n] is each of the numbers 1 through 9, in order.

    The first man page found according to these criteria will be displayed.
    (Man pages with the suffix '.gz' are compressed, and will require that you
    have gzip installed in order to view.)


  PAGER

    %PAGER% specifies the pager (program through which the output is redirected)
    used to display the formatted man pages.  If not specified, the default is
    'less'.

    You can use any paging utility you like, as long as it supports redirection
    from STDOUT.  If you have nothing better installed, you can set %PAGER% to
    OS/2's built-in pager, 'more', as long as you don't mind its somewhat
    limited functionality.


  TERM

    Both Cawf and less use make use of the %TERM% environment variable, which is
    the standard Unix terminal type specifier.  If not defined, Simplified MAN
    will assume the value 'os2'.


KNOWN PROBLEMS

  As Cawf is not 100% nroff-compatible, you may occasionally encounter warning
  messages when viewing some man pages.  (The man pages for the links web
  browser are one example.)  This is fairly rare, and the pages are usually still
  quite readable.  This should be considered a permament restriction when using
  Cawf as the formatter.
