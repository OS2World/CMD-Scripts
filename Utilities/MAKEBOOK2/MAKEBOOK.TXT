About MAKEBOOK
==============

        MAKEBOOK.CMD is a REXX utility designed to create icons for the OS/2
on-line reference manuals located on your OS/2 system.  This utility will
search all available drives (including network drives) for OS/2 .INF files and
create icons for them with the appropriate titles.
        MAKEBOOK.CMD uses the following logic process when it searches your
hard disk for .INF files:

1.)  MAKEBOOK.CMD starts with the root directory of drive C: and searches all
     available subdirectories for files with a .INF extension.
2.)  When MAKEBOOK.CMD obtains a listing of all files on drive C: with an .INF
     extension, it compares the filename with two different lists of .INF file
     names.  
     a.)  The first list MAKEBOOK.CMD uses is a listing known OS/2 .INF
          files and their corresponding titles.  When MAKEBOOK.CMD finds a 
          match in this list, the name of this book is automatically set to the
          appropriate title for the book.
     b.)  If an .INF file name is not found in the first list, MAKEBOOK.CMD
          checks with a second list.  The second list contains the names of
          files that are not OS/2 on-line books but do end with an .INF 
          extension.  MAKEBOOK.CMD will display a message that the file found
          is not an OS/2 on-line book and an icon will not be created.
     c.)  If an .INF file is not found in either of the above lists, an icon 
          will be created for the book using the file name for a title.
3.)  All icons will be created in a folder created on your OS/2 desktop titled 
     "MAKEBOOK.CMD - Find Results."

        MAKEBOOK.CMD is a REXX utility which means that you can modify it to
include descriptive titles for .INF files not listed in either of the two 
lists.  The logic used by MAKEBOOK.CMD is a simple IF...THEN statement.  The 
following is an example from the list of known .INF files:

when BookName="REXX.INF" then BookName="REXX Information"

The following is an example from the list of files with a .INF extension which
are not OS/2 .INF files:

when BookName="OEMSETUP.INF" then Say "OEMSETUP.INF"NADA

NOTE: NADA is a variable used to store the generic text string "is not an OS/2
      on-line book"  This is used in order to keep the size of MAKEBOOK.CMD
      down to a minimium.

The BookName variable is a global variable which initially holds the file name 
of the .INF file in question.  The value of BookName will change depending on
whether the file name is found in either of the lists.

History
=======
03.16.93 v1.00
        *  Initial Release
07.07.93 v1.01
        *  Fixed a problem with parameters field of the object that is created.
           The drive on which the .INF file resides is not included in the
           parameters section; therefore, when you go to look at the
           book, you get an error that "Cannot open input files."
07.27.93 v1.02
        *  Fixed a problem with the Express Setup query in that it would not
           recognize the capital letter Y or N.  The Express Setup option will
           no longer echo your key to the screen.
