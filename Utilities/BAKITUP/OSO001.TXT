PURPOSE:  OSO001.MSG is a patched version of the system
message file for OS/2 2.0.  It was made from the one furnished
with the system by patching it with DEBUG.  The only difference
is that the prompt for inserting a new backup diskette for
BACKUP is conspicuously different from the one calling for the
last backup diskette.  It reads "NEW DISK, STUPID", and contains
a couple of beeps to help alert the user that a disk change is
needed.  I made the change because the prompts for the a new
disk and for the old disk are easily mistaken, and if you hit 
Enter at the wrong time you can clobber a backup diskette.
 
For my money, this is a change that IBM ought to make to the
BACKUP program, but until they do so, I will use this method.

NOTE:  This file has only been used with OS/2 2.0 with the 
service pack installed.  It probably would work on 2.0 GA.  

INSTALLATION:  The only hard thing is to get to an OS/2 command
prompt without having the system controlling access to the
original OSO001.MSG file.  To do that, boot your system with the
installation diskette, and follow the directions until the blue
screen appears and asks you to press Enter to continue or press
Esc.  Press Esc and you will get an OS/2 command prompt.

Change drive to your OS/2 boot drive.  Change the directory
to \OS2\SYSTEM.  Copy the existing OSO001.MSG file to a name
of your choice (I used OSO001.BAK) just in case you want to
recover.  Copy the patched OSO001.MSG to the \OS2\SYSTEM directory
and reboot normally.

REMOVAL:  Follow the steps described above to get to the OS/2
boot drive without system control of the OSO001.MSG file.  Then
delete the patched version of OSO001.MSG and rename the backup
copy to be OSO001.MSG.  Reboot normally.
