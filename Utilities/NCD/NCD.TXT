The 2 files included in this package emulate the Norton Change Directory
DOS program. The file named XCD.CMD uses the basic features of REXX and can
be run from either a full screen group or an OS/2 window. The file named 
VCD.CMD makes use of the Visual REXX package and should only be run from
an OS/2 window. 

I say should, because although it will run from a full 
screen group, the directory selection window only appears on the WPS 
desktop. I have not found a way in REXX to determine if I am currently 
running in a full screen group or an OS/2 window session.

The CMD files are pretty well comented so they should be easy to understand
and modify.

If anyone has any suggestions on how to improve the program, I can be 
reached on Compuserve at 76666,1043 or at (714)380-6362.

Hope it proves useful.
