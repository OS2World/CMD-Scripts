Iris V0.1 15.08.2003
-----------------------

Requirements:
Infozip's zip.exe
eCS or OS/2 with REXX

Installation:
1) Unzip the files in a directory of your choice
2) Change the settings in iris.cmd
3) If you want a WPS object, execute wps.cmd.


Use:
1) Simply start it either by a scheduler or with a doubleclick
2) Have a look into the logfiles


What it does:
1) It finds your bootdrive out. This may sometimes fail (when the OS2.INI ain't
   placed on the bootdrive), but you have still the possibility to enter a value.
2) Then it looks where the swapper.dat is save and excludes it if nessesary.
3) An at last it creates the backup file. It's name has the format :
   backup_YYYY_MM_DD.zip
4) If a file with that name already exists, then the execution is interrupted,
   to prevent overwriting backup files.

Known bugs:
I hope non, but please let me know if you find one!
Please send me any kind of feedback to improve it or do it yourself: 
it's GNU software...
