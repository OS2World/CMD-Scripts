WINSTALL --- WIN-OS/2 Installation Utility for OS/2 Warp v3 (TM)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This utility is distributed free into the public domain.  No warranty is made
as the performance or suitability of this code for user purposes, and no
liability for damage to data, equipment, loss of revenue or impairment of
physical or emotional health due to use of this program is assumed.  Use at
your own risk.  THIS PROCEDURE IS NOT SUPPORTED BY IBM AND YOU SHOULD NOT
EXPECT SUPPORT FOR YOUR OS/2 WARP V 3 SYSTEM IF YOU HAVE USED THIS UTILITY
TO INSTALL WIN-OS/2 SUPPORT ON THE CURRENT VERSION OF OS/2 3.0 WHICH IS 
DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR USE WITH MICROSOFT WINDOWS(TM) 3.11.
                                                          
This program should only be used by those holding valid IBM OS/2 2.10 or 2.11
AND OS/2 Warp v3 licenses.  Note that 'UPGRADE' licenses may exclude
concurrent use of code on different systems.

This utility requires you to have OS/2 v 2.10 full version (with WIN-OS/2) and
OS/2 2.11 CSD full version diskettes or a backup of \os2\mdos\winos2 and 
\os2\mdos\winos2\system directories to build a fully functional WIN-OS/2.  If
you do not 2.11 level WIN-OS/2 files,  you will probably not find seamless
WIN-OS/2 support satisfactory.  Though seamless programs will load and run on
the desktop, they can only be maximized and restored, but not resized, moved,
or minimized, and can sometimes hang the system.  In addition, to run seam-
less WIN-OS/2 you will need a video card with Warp supported drivers for SVGA,
XGA, or 8514 mode --- at least I have not found it possible to run seamless in
VGA using drivers for my TVGA8900CL card.  If you have a backup of the winos2
and winos2\system directories after 2.11 CSD application, you may wish to skip
the 2.11 disks and restore your 2.11 winos2 directory and subdirectories after
running WINSTALL.  Be aware that many programs enter data and replace
Windows(TM) drivers,and that restoring may not lead to a successful install of
WIN-OS/2.

You will also need OS/2 Warp v3 on diskette or CD-ROM, and may wish to use
Inimaint (Carey Associates) or a similar utility to backup your desktop.
Backup your system before attempting to install WIN-OS/2 support.  WINSTALL
also requires you to use ED or TEDIT to change path information in the
config.sys file, and autoexec.bat files, as well as system.ini file, and
progman.ini files.

Use selective install to put your system into standard VGA configuration
before using WINSTALL unless you are running default XGA configurations on
hardware that uses the OS/2 standard XGA drivers (XGA default not tested by
author). For the ATI Graphics Ultra Pro and other unsupported cards, if not
running in 8514 mode you may be restricted to full screen WIN-OS/2, and will 
have to manually install the drivers. 

After running WINSTALL you will have a little more work to do (which I hope 
to automate in the next update):

1. Add C:\os2\mdos\winos2\system; to the config.sys LIBPATH line.
2. Add C:\os2\mdos\winos2; to the config.sys PATH line.
3. Add C:\os2\mdos\winos2\system; to the config.sys DPATH line.
4. Add DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VWIN.SYS to the end of CONFIG.SYS
5. Add DEVICE=C:\OS2\MDOS\VW32S.SYS to the end of CONFIG.SYS 
   (Still tinkering to see if WIN-OS/2 can be made compatible)
   (with win32s. VW32S.SYS probably not needed otherwise.    )
6. Add C:\os2\mdos\winos2 & C:\os2\mdos\winos2\system to
   your autoexec.bat PATH statement (very important since its
   hard to figure out why it's still not working.)
      And if not using default XGA setup ....
7. Following reboot BEFORE running WIN-OS/2 run selective install to 
   change your system video to an SVGA resolution supported by your  
   equipment, AFTER making the following changes to WIN-OS/2 files:  
8. Edit C:\os2\mdos\winos2\system.ini and change all references 
   to 'xga' to 'vga'.
9. Edit C:\os2\mdos\winos2\progman.ini and change all references
   to 'xga' to 'vga'.

I have also included a separate utility to recreate the WIN-OS/2 objects if
you find it necessary to so (mkwinobj.cmd), or that is all you need.

After rebooting from selective install, WIN-OS/2 should run in both Seamless
& Full-Screen. As I have just discovered, however, even using Windows 3.1, 
selectively uninstalling and then selective installing WIN-OS/2 support can
fail under OS/2 Warp v3 using the IBM installation utilities.
