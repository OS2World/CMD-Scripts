IPFormatToText User's Guide v0.3
================================

IPFormatToText takes the output of ipformat and rewrites the DATA sections
as text.  Ipformat formats these sections as a combination of hex and text.
If the logged DATA is mostly readable text, as is the case with many TCP/IP
application protocols, the output of IPFormatToText is easier to read and
analyze than the output of ipformat alone.


Installation
============

The script may be installed in a directory of your choice. If you use it a
lot, you probably will want to install it in a directory in the PATH.


Usage
=====

To run the script, invoke it with the names of one or more files containing
ipformat output.  If run with no arguments, the script will read from stdin.
Output will be written to stdout.

There are some optional command line switches.  Switches are unix style and
begin with a dash (-) and are case-sensitive.  Slashes (/) will not work.
The switches are:

  -h	Display usage help.
  -V	Display version info and exit.

The following is a typical example of how iptrace, ipformat and
IPFormatToText would be used together.  Set up your test environment and start
tracing with

  iptrace

Let iptrace run until you have collected sufficient data.  Then press the
Enter key to stop iptrace.

Format the captured data with

  ipformat >ipformat.lst

If ipformat displays the message

 Opening IPTRACE.DMP ...  FAILED

You are not in the directory that contains iptrace.dmp.  You need to resolve
this problem before continuing.

If ipformat displays the messages

 Opening IPTRACE.DMP ...  Successful
 Reading packet headers ...  Unable to read 1st header

iptrace has not captured any data.  You need to resolve this problem before
continuing.

Reformat the ipformat output with

  IPFormatToText ipformat.lst >ipformat.txt

Ipformat to text will contain the reformatted output.
