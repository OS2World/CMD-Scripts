*********************

New NETSTCMD.CMD is an updated intelligent script to start Peer Services.
NETEND.CMD is a new script that intelligently does a clean shutdown of Peer Services when used with eStyler.
Both scripts are useful on Laptops where systems may or may not have network access.
The scripts check for network access and determine whether a Network logon/logoff is necessary or not.

* Dosn't show "Black" command windows.
* System boots up and LAN Dialog pops up requesting USERID & PASSWORD.
* If USERID is logged on another workstation, dosn't show annoying popup message.
* Clear LogOn/LogOff...again no Command Windows Pop-up in front of the users face.

INSTALLATION:
*********************
COPY the new NETSTCMD.CMD & NETEND.CMD to the x:\IBMLAN\NETPROG directory on your boot drive where eComStation is installed. The original NETSTCMD.CMD will be overwritten. Backup the original if you want to keep it!

"x:" is the drive where eComStation is installed.

Here are some recommended changes to have a clean "Logon" or "Logoff" window open without seeing the "Black command window".
This provides a cleaner look for logon and logoff on systems with Peer Services installed. By forcing the user to logoff, a clean logoff prevents the Domain Logon from showing on the next reboot.



1.) Move "Start File & Print Client" object from "Startup" folder to 
"Local System" folder

2.) Edit x:\TCPIP\BIN\TCPSTART.CMD to read as follows:

Find the section: "echo ..... FINISHED STARTING THE TCP/IP PROCESSES"

After that line enter the following..leaving out quotation marks:

"echo .... Starting Peer Networking Services
START /C /MIN x:\IBMLAN\NETPROG\NETSTCMD.CMD"

So it should look like this:
------------------------------------------------------------------
echo ..... FINISHED STARTING THE TCP/IP PROCESSES

echo .... Starting Peer Networking Services
START /C /MIN x:\IBMLAN\NETPROG\NETSTCMD.CMD

:DONESERVERS
------------------------------------------------------------------

3.) Open "eStyler Preferences" found in the "System Setup" 
folder located in the "Appearance" folder of the eCenter.

4.) Click on the "ShutDown" Tab...Click to page 2 of 2.

5.)  In the field marked "Program:" enter:

x:\IBMLAN\NETPROG\NETEND.CMD

6.) In the field marked "Window:" choose "Minimized"

7.) Click the "Add" button at the bottom

8.) Thats it!

Note:  Make sure that in the "System Shutdown" dialog box (it will show when you shut your system down), that you have the box "Execute shutdown programs" checked!

Note: If their is a problem during the starting of File/Print 
services..or LogOn...the sessions won't close and will stay visible in
the eCenter's Window List.
