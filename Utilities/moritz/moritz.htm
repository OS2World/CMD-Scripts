Moritz V0.13 18.06.2008<br>
-----------------------<br>
<br>
Bugfix:<br>
- Update from W4 Kernel 14.086 to 14.104a recognized 14.086 as Kernel type '4'<br>
  resulting in message ' This seems to be a wrong kernel! Please apply this kernel only if you'<br>
- Update did not work because some '\' are missing in building correct path names<br>
<br>
Authoring:<br>
  The orignal program url is dead. So I did not try to contact the author and publish directly to hobbes.<br>
<br>
Moritz V0.12 28.06.2002
<br>
-----------------------
<p>
Requirements:
<br>
To apply a new kernel: eCS or OS/2 with REXX, UNZIP.EXE somewhere in PATH
<br>
and optionaly LxLite
<br>
To restore the old kernel: only a functionaly command line.
<p>
Installation:
<br>
Unzip the files in a directory and then start the script wps.cmd.
<p>
<p>
Use:
<br>
1) Download the kernel update (W4xxxx.zip, SMPxxxx.zip oder UNIxxxx.zip) from
<br>
testcase.
<br>
2) Drag and drop it on the WPS-Object called Moritz
<br>
3) Follow the instruktions (mostly: just read the information on screen;-)
<br>
4) Reboot!
<p>
NEW! If you want do undo the apply of the kernel files, start moritz_undo.cmd
<br>
at your bootdrive root directory.
<p>
What it does:
<br>
1) It compares the given kernel file with the installed
<br>
2) If the user decides to proceed, it...
<br>
3) ... makes copies of the kernel and the loader in a directory created at
<br>
BOOTDRIVE:\OS2\ARCHIVES\Kernel_Backup\OLD_KERNEL
<br>
4) It unpacks the kernel file in the working directory (where moritz.cmd
<br>
is installed) and from there it moves the kernel and the loader to the
<br>
root of the bootdrive. All other files are left here, because only
<br>
kernel gurus may need then (for tracing) or they are information files
<br>
or drivers. Please have a look here!
<br>
5) After all, it creates a batch file called moritz_undo.cmd, which will
<br>
restore the last kernel.
<p>
<p>
Known bugs:
<br>
None ;-) But as I have only a one processor maschine with eCS and Warp 4,
<br>
I could verify the functionality only for W4-kernels. Please send me
<br>
any kind of feedback to improve it or do it yourself: it's GNU software...

Thanks for feedbacks to:

Michel Goyette
<br>

<p>
Thanks for the kind words in the kernel README:

<br>
Also, there are some REXX scripts written by third parties that might make
<br>
installation/archiving of your kernels easier. Go to http://hobbes.nmsu.edu
<br>
and search for "moritz", for example. This is unsupported by IBM!
