-----------------------

Bugfix:
- Update from W4 Kernel 14.086 to 14.104a recognized 14.086 as Kernel type '4'
  resulting in message ' This seems to be a wrong kernel! Please apply this kernel only if you'
- Update did not work because some '\' are missing in building correct path names

Authoring:
  The orignal program url is dead. So I did not try to contact the author and publish directly to hobbes.

-----------------------

Requirements:
To apply a new kernel: eCS or OS/2 with REXX, UNZIP.EXE somewhere in PATH
and optionaly LxLite
To restore the old kernel: only a functionaly command line.

Installation:
Unzip the files in a directory and then start the script wps.cmd.


Use:
1) Download the kernel update (W4xxxx.zip, SMPxxxx.zip oder UNIxxxx.zip) from 
   testcase.
2) Drag and drop it on the WPS-Object called Moritz
3) Follow the instruktions (mostly: just read the information on screen;-)
4) Reboot!

NEW! If you want do undo the apply of the kernel files, start moritz_undo.cmd
at your bootdrive root directory.

What it does:
1) It compares the given kernel file with the installed
2) If the user decides to proceed, it...
3) ... makes copies of the kernel and the loader in a directory created at 
   BOOTDRIVE:\OS2\ARCHIVES\Kernel_Backup\OLD_KERNEL
4) It unpacks the kernel file in the working directory (where moritz.cmd
   is installed) and from there it moves the kernel and the loader to the
   root of the bootdrive. All other files are left here, because only
   kernel gurus may need then (for tracing) or they are information files
   or drivers. Please have a look here!
5) After all, it creates a batch file called moritz_undo.cmd, which will
   restore the last kernel.


Known bugs:
None ;-) But as I have only a one processor maschine with eCS and Warp 4,
I could verify the functionality only for W4-kernels. Please send me
any kind of feedback to improve it or do it yourself: it's GNU software...

This Program is released under the Gnu Public Licence (GPL).
See the file COPYING for further information.

Thanks for feedbacks to:

Thanks for the kind words in the kernel README:

(....
Also, there are some REXX scripts written by third parties that might make
installation/archiving of your kernels easier. Go to http://hobbes.nmsu.edu
and search for "moritz", for example. This is unsupported by IBM!
