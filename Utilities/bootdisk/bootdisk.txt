/* BOOTDISK.CMD for OS/2 2.1 GA by James K. Beard CIS 71675,566        */
/* Two-disk OS/2 2.1 GA boot; packs 1.2 MB in A:, 1.1 MB in B:
   Supported on floppy are CHKDSK, FORMAT, FDISK, BACKUP, RESTORE
   Sufficient room remains on B: (if 1.44 MB) for HPFS, your SCSI
   drivers, the IBM Tiny Editor, etc.  Use the procedure in Appendix C
   of the OS/2 manual to backup and restore the worplace shell, or use
   the shareware WPSBACKUP.

   Modified from MAKEBOOT.CMD version 1.00 by Donald L. Meyer,
   internet:   dlmeyer@uiuc.edu

     This program accepts one parameter:
     * "RECON" tells program to skip main install, and only do optional
       installation of things like SCSI support, etc.
    Thanks go out to Morton Kaplon  (73457,437 @ Compuserve) for
    doing the legwork determining which files/drivers were/weren't
    necessary for Donald L. Meyer's 2.0 version, and David Moskowitz's
    article in "OS/2 2.1 Unleashed" (Sams, 1993) pp 57-59. */
