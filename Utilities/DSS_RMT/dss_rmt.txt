========================================================================
DSS_RMT.CMD v1.3 - REXX script for controlling Doodle's Screen Saver
========================================================================


Overview
------------------------------------------------------------------------

After more than 13 years using OS/2, I found Doodle's Screen Saver
(DSSaver), which has exactly the features, I've been looking for.

The most important features for me are

- DSSaver doesn't crash my system, when it blanks the screen while i'm
  looking TV or DVD.

- DSSaver offers an API for 3rd party programs.


DSS_RMT can be used to ..

.. disable DSSaver temporary. To prevent that DSSaver will be disabled
   forever, the user can specify a timeout to enable DSSaver again
   automatically.

.. enable DSSaver

.. disable DSSaver, if certain processes are running. DSS_RMT has a
   watchdog that queries the running processes periodically for
   processes definied by the user.

.. instruct DSSaver to blank the screen immediately


System requirements
------------------------------------------------------------------------

- OS/2 Warp 4
  DSS_RMT has been tested under OS/2 Warp 4 FP 10 only, but i think eCS
  will be OK too.

- Classic REXX
  DSS_RMT has not been tested with Object REXX.

- Doodle's Screen Saver
  DSS_RMT has been tested with DSSaver 1.4 and 1.5

- RXU 1.a - a rich set of Rexx functions for OS/2 API


Optional

- PMPRINTF - displays the 'screen'-output of DSS_RMT server task

Included files
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The original archive DSS_RMT_V13.ZIP includes the following files:

DSS_RMT.TXT     Documentation
DSS_RMT.CMD     The executable REXX script
DSS_RMT.CFG     Sample configuration file



Installing DSS_RMT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install DSS_RMT just copy DSS_RMT.CMD into a directory of your choice.
If you want to use the process watchdog or if you want to change the
the default values, DSS_RMT.CFG must be in the same directory.

If you have installed DSS_RMT 1.2, just copy the new DSS_RMT.CMD and
DSS_RMT.TXT over the old ones. You do not need to edit old DSS_RMT.CFG.
If the servertask of DSS_RMT.CMD is still running, kill it by calling
DSS_RMT.CMD -K and start the new servertask by calling DSS_RMT.CMD -S.



Usage
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSS_RMT.CMD [-S|-SFG|-K|-D|-E|-B|-Q]

Options:

-S      Before you can use DSS_RMT to controll DSSaver, you
        have to start the server task of DSS_RMT.
        Calling DSS_RMT.CMD -S will start the server task of DSS_RMT
        in a detached session.

-SFG    This option is almost the same as -S, but will start the server
        task of DSS_RMT in a new window as a foreground session. This
        option is mainly for debugging purposes. The window of the
        server task will be kept open after termination.

-K      Terminates the server task of DSS_RMT.

-D      Request to disable DSSaver temporary
        If DSSaver has been disabled earlier by calling DSS_RMT.CMD -D,
        the timer for auto enable will be reset.

-E      Request to enable DSSaver

-Q      Displays the status of the server task

-B      Blanks the screen immediately

If no option is given, DSS_RMT.CMD will show a short help.




Errorlevels
------------------------------------------------------------------------

0     No error

By calling DSS_RMT.CMD with option -D, -E or -Q an errorlevel of 0 .. 7
reflects the status of the server task and of DSSaver.
The errorlevel is bitwise coded:

      Bit 2   Bit 1   Bit 0
0       0       0       0
1       0       0       1
2       0       1       0
3       0       1       1
4       1       0       0
5       1       0       1
6       1       1       0
7       1       1       1


      Bit 0 is set if DSSaver has been disable teporary by a request
      with DSS_RTM.CMD -D. Calling DSS_RMT.CMD -E will reset Bit 0.

      Bit 1 is set if the watchdog has detected that one or more tasks
      defined with the keyword PROCESS are running. If none of these
      processes are running Bit 1 will be reset.

      By using SSCore.DLL version 1.4 or lower, Bit 2 is reset
      all the time. SSCore.DLL version 1.5 has a funtion, which inform
      about the state of the screen saver. Then Bit 2 is set if DSSaver
      has blanked the screen.



99    DSS_RMT.CMD has been called with no command line option.
      The help screen has been displayed.

100   The server task has been terminated by pressing CTRL-C.

200   Error freeing SSCore.DLL

244   A function called from SSCore.DLL returns an error code.

245   Error reading status of server task

246   Error creating semaphores

247   Error loading SSCore.DLL
      SScore.DLL is part of DSSaver and must be in a directory
      of the LIBPATH statement.

248   Timeout terminating server
      Calling DSS_RMT.CMD -K will instruct the server task to terminate.
      If the server task is still running after 20 seconds, the
      errorlevel will be set to 248.

249   The server task is already running.

250   The server task is not running.

251   Error starting server task
      Calling DSS_RMT.CMD -S or DSS_RMT.CMD -SFG will instruct DSS_RMT
      to start the server task. If the server task is not running within
      20 seconds, the errorlevel will be set to 251.

252   Timeout requesting mutexsemaphore \SEM32\DSS_RMT\ACCESS_CTRL.SEM
      This semaphore is used to control communication with the server
      task. If the request is not successful within 20 seconds, the
      errorlevel will be set to 252.

253   Error creating or opening \SEM32\DSS_RMT\ACCESS_CTRL.SEM
      On startup DSS_RMT tries to open or to create the mentioned
      semaphore. If opening or creating of the semaphore has been failed
      for 20 seconds, the errorlevel will be set to 253.

254   DSS_RMT.CMD has been called with an invalid or more than one
      command line option.



Files used by DSS_RMT.CMD
------------------------------------------------------------------------

DSS_RMT.PID

This file will be created in the directory of DSS_RMT.CMD by the server
task of DSS_RMT and contains the PID of the server task. DSS_RMT.PID
will be kept open by the server task in share mode 'deny write'.
Therefore this file can't be modified or deleted while the server task
is running. By terminating the server task, DSS_RMT.PID will be deleted.


DSS_RMT.CFG

This file can be used to set some preferences of DSS_RMT and must be in
the directory of DSS_RMT.CMD


If DSS_RMT.CMD has been renamed, than the PID file will
be <New Name>.PID and the configuration file will be <New Name>.CFG




Configuration file DSS_RMT.CFG
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The configuration file will be read by the server task of DSS_RMT.CMD.
After editing DSS_RMT.CFG it is a good idea to call DSS_RMT.CMD -SFG to
check the correctness of the new DSS_RMT.CFG.

The configuration file may contain empty lines. Comments must be
preceeded by a ';'. Everything following the ';' will be ignored.

The keywords are not case sensitive.



PMPRINTF      [<queue>]

By specifying the keyword PMPRINTF the server task of DSS_RMT is enabled
to send the screen output to PMPRINTF. If the queue name is not
specified, the output will be sent to the default queue of PMPRINTF.



TIMEOUT_DIS   <0..999999>

The keyword TIMEOUT_DIS defines the time in seconds, after which the
server task will enable DSSaver automatically after it has been disabled
by calling DSS_RMT.CMD -D.

Setting TIMEOUT_DIS to a suitable value will prevent DSSaver to be
disabled forever, if it is not enabled by calling DSS_RMT.CMD -E.

A value of 0 will disable the auto enable feature. If TIMEOUT_DIS is not
specified or if the given value is invalid, the default timeout is set
to 10800 seconds = 3 hours.



TIMEOUT_PROC  <1..999999>

DSS_RMT.CMD is able to disable DSSaver, if certain processes are
running. Therefore the server task has a watchdog, which queries the
running processes periodically. TIMEOUT_PROC defines the time in
seconds between two queries.

The specified time should be shorter than the inactivity time, after
which DSSaver will blank the screen. If TIMEOUT_PROC is not specified
or if the given value is invalid, the default timeout ist set to
300 seconds = 5 minutes.



PROCESS       [path]<name>

The watchdog of DSS_RMT.CMD will search the running processes for processes
specified with the keyword PROCESS. If a specified process is running,
the watchdog will disable DSSaver. DSSaver will be enabled again, if
the specified processes has been terminated.

Normally the process name is an EXE-file. This file can be specified
with or without fully qualified path name. If the name contains spaces,
it must be enclosed in double quotes.

Examples:

  PROCESS   tv.exe          ;will detect tv.exe regardless of the path
  PROCESS   e:\tools\tv.exe ;will detect e:\tools\tv.exe but not f:\prg\tv.exe
  PROCESS   "e:\dvd tools\tv.exe"
  PROCESS   "clean up.exe"




History of DSS_RMT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

v1.2    First public release.


v1.3    DSS_RMT calls SSCore_GetInfo to determine the version of SSCore.DLL.

        If DSSaver v1.5 is installed, DSS_RMT will call
        SSCore_GetCurrentState to determine the current state of the
        screen saver. In this case SSCore_StartSavingNow will be called
        only, if the screen saver ist in normal state (screen is not
        blanked).
