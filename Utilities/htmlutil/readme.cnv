HTMLutil - readme.cnv - 950823

This (very preliminary) package for HTML contains the following files:

   HTMLconv.cmd   - Text to/from, IPF to HTML converter ;
   ipftags.437    - symbols definitions for IPF (code page 437) ;
   ipftags.850    - symbols definitions for IPF (code page 850) ;
   htmltags.437   - symbols definitions for HTML (code page 437) ;
   htmltags.850   - symbols definitions for HTML (code page 850) ;
   htmltags.def   - HTML definition file for EBOOKIE ;
   profile.cnv    - a sample profile file for HTMLconv ;
   readme.cnv     - this file.


What's that?
============

   HTMLutil tries to help you creating HTML documents.  It contains
   HTML definition files for EBOOKIE, an excellent package for EPM,
   and a converter, which can be used to convert from HTML to text,
   from text to HTML and from IPF to HTML.


What's new?
===========

   o bkmtags.437 and bkmtags.850 renamed ipftags.* ;
   o more tags in htmltags.def (tables, ...) ;
   o speed improvement in HTMLconv ;
   o HTMLconv uses ipftags.* instead of bkmtags.* ;
   o uppercase tags are now recognized in IPF files ;
   o HTML file can be 'splitted' by header level ;
   o minor bug fixes in HTMLconv (version is now 0.09.000) ;
   o a .BMP to .GIF converter can be used, if available.


How to install?
===============

   Copy HTMLconv.cmd somewhere along your PATH, profile.cnv somewhere
   along your DPATH and *tags.* somewhere along your EPMPATH.

   That's all.

   [If you're not using EBOOKIE, you can safely remove htmltags.def.]


How to use?
===========

   To use the EBOOKIE part, simply load an HTML file, and execute the
   following EPM commands :

      bookie on
      bookief HTMLTAGS.DEF

   [The EBOOKIE package must have been properly installed.]


   To use HTMLconv, simply call it with the correct command line
   parameters (without parameters, a small help screen is displayed).

   Here are typical commands:

      HTMLconv -i mydoc.ipf mydoc.html    - creates mydoc.html and
                                            toc.html.
      HTMLconv mydoc.html mydoc.txt       - creates mydoc.txt
      HTMLconv -t mydoc.txt mydoc.htm     - creates mydoc.htm
      HTMLconv -i big.ipf big??.html      - creates big01.html,
                                            big02.html, ... and
                                            toc.html

   [HTMLconv configuration can be tailored via PROFILE.CNV.]


Known problems/limitations:
===========================

   The HTML to text conversion simply removes HTML tags and translates
   HTML symbols.

   The text to HTML conversion simply translates symbols.  No
   formatting is performed.

   [By translating symbols, I mean swapping from, say, '‚' to '&eacute;'
   and back from '&eacute;' to '‚'...]

   The IPF to HTML conversion is very simple, too:

      It produces a table of content (toc.html by default), which
      contains links to headers (by default, levels 1, 2 and 3), and a
      main document, which contains the completely expanded IPF
      document.

      The following tags are translated:

         :artwork.  :c.  :dl.  :h1. - :h6.  :hp1. - :hp7.  :li.  :link.
         :note.  :ol.  :p.  :row.  :table.  :ul.  :userdoc.  :xmp.

      [Yes, all others tags are skipped :-( ]

      .im, .br and .* are correctly processed, though.

      And it's slow... (1mn/50kb on my 486DX33)

   You cannot specify the table of contents file name from the command
   line (toc.html by default), but you can overrides it in your
   PROFILE.CNV.
