        Desc.:  To all those who have a OS/2 drive with a HPFS partition,
                another drive with a FAT partition and a tape streamer
                without OS/2 2.0 support...

                Requires EABACKUP V2.x (available from hobbes)
                     and ZOO V2.x (available from hobbes) or any
                     other file compression utility.

        __ BACK2FAT.DOC __________________________________________________

        BACK2FAT.CMD acts as a shell in calling other (PD) programs to
        create a backup of a specified fileset from a HPFS drive to a
        FAT drive.

        BACK2FAT.CMD is designed as a template for your own backup jobs.

        BACK2FAT.CMD is a REXX program which may easily be changed for
        personal preferences and other environments.

        (I hope it doesn't bore if I now start with my personal story...)
        I have been using OS/2 2.0 with pleasure for two months now.
        The only drop of bitterness so far ist that one vital program does
        not run in the DOS box:

              SYTOS plus for DOS

        This is vital in so far as my WANGTEK tape streamer with its own
        controller/adapter is worthless under OS/2 ...

        Rumors telling me that a support should be introduced in this fall
        but Pinocchio is a true story either.

        So I have written my first REXX program (it's not my last one but,
        personally, I prefer C and C++) to have a 'comfortable' shell for
        the classic backup programs EABACKUP and ZOO.

        So I do backup my files to my second (FAT) harddrive, boot under
        pure DOS, run SYTOS and sleep much better from now on!

        If you, the honorable reader of this magnificient document, have
        similar problems, my (\TMP) solution might help you.

        So this is what you have to do:

        __________________________________________________________________
        __ INSTALL _______________________________________________________

        BACK2FAT requires ...

           þ OS/2 2.0 (That's what the mess is alll about)
           þ EABACKUP Version 2.x for backing up Extended Attributes
           þ ZOO Version 2.x for backing up files

        If you prefer another file compression utility you must adapt
        BACK2FAT accordingly. (This is quite definitely your problem!)
        (You need to know how to program in REXX which is *no* magic.)

        Copy BACK2FAT.CMD (and this DOC file) to a directory of your
        choice.

           Either:

              Copy EABACKUP.EXE to the same directory
              Copy ZOO.EXE to the same directory

           Or:

              Be shure that EABACKUP.EXE is in a directory of your PATH
                      environment.
              Be shure that ZOO.EXE is in a directory of your PATH
                      environment.

        If you do not know, what a PATH environment is (maybe because
        you are totally object-oriented and do not care for those technical
        details), refer to your OS/2 Online Manual for a description or
        fulfill the first condition!

        That's it.

        BACK2FAT automatically searches for its spawned programs and
        generates an error message if it cannot find them. This is
        done by a nice REXX system call...

        NOTE: On my system I have installed the APA's PJ03945 and PJ04178
              and I don't know whether my program requires them or not.
              I didn't have the time to check this out, sorry.
              These patches are available from hobbes as something like
              REXX20.ZOO

        __________________________________________________________________
        __ ADAPTION ______________________________________________________

        BACK2FAT.CMD is designed as a template for your own backup jobs.

        So this means you have to do a little bit!!!

        You do not have know anything about REXX or so, it's really easy
        do 'patch' the program, don't be shy...


        The program must be called with at least one argument describing
        a fileset. A fileset is a drive/path specification of the files
        which are to be backuped.

        The filesets are hardcoded within the program and must be edited
        to fit to your environment!

        There are 5 filesets already defined in the program which suit to
        my environment. Unless you change your whole filesystem to the
        same structure as mine you have to edit the fileset names and
        their underlying filespecs!

        So use your favorite editor (e.g EDLIN) and edit BACK2FAT.CMD
        Around line #212 there should be something like

        ----
        global.fileset.1     = "OS2  -->   C:\OS2"    /* OS2 system files */
        global.fileset.2     = "APP  -->   C:\APP"    /* applications */
        global.fileset.3     = "BIN  -->   C:\BIN"    /* 'binaries', tools */
        global.fileset.4     = "ETC  -->   C:\ETC"    /* other system files */
        global.fileset.5     = "LIB  -->   C:\LIB"    /* libraries */
        /* ... more ... */
        global.fileset_num   = 5       /* must contain number of filesets! */
        ---

        If your built-in-pattern-matcher works with a low-priority threshold
        you should already recognize the trick.

        If you just see objects (letters, punctuation signs, crazy things)
        I have to catch another breath and explain it:

        A fileset definition looks like:

        global.fileset.1  = "OS2  -->   C:\OS2"  /* OS2 system files */

        ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ ^  ^  ^     ^     ^       ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                ³      ³  ³  ³     ³     ³                 ³
                ³      ³  ³  ³     ³     ³                 À REXX comment
                ³      ³  ³  ³     ³     ³
                ³      ³  ³  ³     ³     À file specification (used as backup source)
                ³      ³  ³  ³     À separator (must be here)
                ³      ³  ³  À fileset (command line argument)
                ³      ³  ³
                ³      ³  À guess what it does
                ³      ³
                ³      À must be a unique number for each definition!!!
                ³
                À REXX Stuff

        So invent an own name for a fileset and attach a file specification
        to it!
        Be shure that all fileset definitions have a uniqe number!
        Be shure that the first fileset definition has number "1"!
        After having defined all your filesets be shure that the next line
        is:

        global.fileset_num   = 5       /* must contain number of filesets! */
                               ^
                               ³
                               À must be the number of the last definition!


        YOU GOT IT, EH???

        After having saved the file with your personal editor save and exit
        command (for EDLIN its: W <Ù, Q <Ù) run it!

        __________________________________________________________________
        __ ADAPTION TO ANOTHER COMPRESSION PROGRAM _______________________

        This is for those being familiar with the sophisticated REXX
        language (SAA, haha).

        You need to change the "global.eabckup_pgm" and "global.eabckup_add"
        constants in the "b2f_init" procedure.
        Also, you have to rewrite the "b2f_backup" procedure.

        I think that the program has good comments and is not too
        compleictaddade, eh, complicated for someone else to edit.

        Feel free to work on it, let me know your modifications!

        __________________________________________________________________
        __ RUNNING IT ____________________________________________________

        Running it without any arguments or with a "/?" or "-?" switch
        will display further instructions.

        (This was really a fast explanation, was it?)

        __________________________________________________________________
        __ DONATIONS _____________________________________________________

        If you want to send money, feel free to do it.

        I will not prevent you from doing so.

        (Since I only have a NEC 3D Multisync which is not capable of
        displaying 1024 x 768 x 16 non-interlaced I urgently need money.)

        If you do not want to send any money, spend it for your own
        pleasure and think of me ...
