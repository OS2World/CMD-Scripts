                        BACK2FT2.DOC
                       --------------

    BACK2FT2.CMD is the modified version of Ralf Hauser's original
    BACK2FAT.CMD.  With his "best wishes", I have made some minor
    changes to the original program which will now allow for using
    the program with PKZIP and ARJ as well as with ZOO.

    Changes in Version 1.02:
    ------------------------

    -  added the ability to backup with PKZIP and ARJ
    -  added more flexibility via command line switches. most
       notably;
           -  the ability to uniquely name the "filename" portion
              of the output file set.
           -  designate which utility program to use
           -  convert all command line arguements to upper case
              for easier manipulation
           -  inserted additional code necessary to handle mul-
              tiple compression utilities

    Notes:
    ------

    If you are a registered user of the ARJ compression utility, the
    "tmpfile" filelist approach used by Ralf will work although the code
    in the b2f_backup procedure will require further, slight modification.

    Also, using the ARJ utility, the '-b1' switch can be added to make
    backups to an already existing backup file with the same output file-
    name.

    I have not made any allowance in this version for return codes other
    than what was originally specified.  This should be done in order to
    act properly when ARJ or PKUNZIP fail to compress properly.  I have,
    however, increased the return code value to any code > than 2 which
    seems to correct the ZOO problem specified by Ralf in his documenta-
    tion.

    Caveats:
    --------

    I have not tested the quality of the compressed files by doing a full
    restore.  I have performed restores on test sub directories and all
    seems to work correctly.  The program does accomplish the desired
    end and has given me the solution to the "HPFS to FAT" backup problem
    using a DOS-based tape drive.

    Operation:
    ----------

    I have created a 75mg FAT drive which I use as the receptacle for my
    backups and which is totally dedicated to this end (what a waste!).
    Be as it may, after I have run this utility and Dave Terry's WPSBackup
    program for preserving the desktop, I have a directory structure which
    looks like the following:

                       SubDirectories   Usage
             G:\       TEMP             Used to keep copies of BU utilities
                       EAJD             Backed up files/ea's from Drive D:
                       EAJF             Backed up files/ea's from Drive F:
                       WPS              Backed up desktop

    The process I have used is to first backup the WPS Desktop.
    Run the BACK2FAT program to preserve files on HPFS drives D: and F:
    To accomplish this, BACK2FAT must be run twice.  I have set up a pro-
    cess to accomplish the first two procedures on a timed basis at night.
    The last step is to reboot DOS 5.0 and run the tape backup program
    which performs a full backup on Drive G:.  This also may be done auto-
    matically by using the "timed approach" from within DesqView.

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    I hope that you find the two versions of BACK2FAT usefull.  Should you
    elect to make further modifications, please include the new "version"
    with the original package along with your documentation of changes.

    Please send copies of changes to Ralf at the address stated in his
    documentation and to me.  Good luck!
