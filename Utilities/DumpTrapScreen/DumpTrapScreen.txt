DumpTrapScreen User's Guide v0.4				12 Oct 2004
================================

DumpTrapScreen takes the output of a trap dump file and extracts the trap 
screens and other useful information.  DumpTrapScreen will work for dump files 
written to either diskette or hard disk.  However, it is most useful for dump 
files on diskette.  Only the first dump diskette is required.

DumpTrapScreen is implemented as a Classic REXX script.


Installation
============

DumpTrapScreen may be installed in a directory of your choice.  If you use it a 
lot, which hopefully is not the case, you should install it to a directory in 
the PATH.


Trap Dump Setup
===============

For kernel traps, you will need to enable trap dumps.  This can be done from 
config.sys with:

 trapdump=R0

or from the OS/2 command line with:

 trapdump R0

This will enable dumps to diskette for kernel ring 0 traps.  There are 
several other setup options.  Use:

  view cmdref trapdump

to review to the other options.  If you have the disk space available, a dump 
partition makes the job of trap analysis much easier.

Additional information is in \os2\system\ras\procdump.doc.

When the system traps, you will be prompted to insert a formatted diskette 
in the drive.  Insert the diskette, tell the dump utility to continue and 
wait for the utility to finish writing the first diskette.  When prompted to 
insert the second diskette, remove the first diskette and reboot the 
computer.  DumpTrapScreen only needs the first diskette.

DumpTrapScreen can be used to extract trap screens from process dump 
files.  However, the Process Dump Formatter is usually a better tool for this 
task.


Using DumpTrapScreen
====================

To run DumpTrapScreen, invoke the script with the name of the trap dump file 
as a parameter.  If the dump file is on diskette, this file will be named:

  a:\dumpdata.001

Output will be written to the standard output (STDOUT).  STDOUT will be the 
screen unless you redirect it to a file.

There are several command line switch options.  Switches are unix style.  
They begin with a dash (-) and are case-sensitive.  Slashes (/) will not 
work.  The switch options are:

  -h	Display usage help
  -d	Display debug info
  -c	Write dump header to tmpdump.out
  -V	Display version info
