WHAT?:  Switches from UNI-PROCESSOR KERNEL TO SMP KERNEL and vice-versa

WHERE?: OS/2 Warp Server for e-Business (aka Aurora)

HOW?:   First, you run "INSTALL.CMD" to copy the neccesary files to the system.
        Once you do that, you can then run "MAKE-UNI.CMD" or "MAKE-SMP.CMD"
        to switch to UNIprocessor or SMP kernel, respectivelly.

WHY?:   Otherwise you have to reboot from floppy (to unlock DLLs) and copy
        files by hand.
