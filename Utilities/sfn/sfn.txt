Short Filename Namer 1.0
------------------------

This REXX script will recursively read all files from a given directory,
mangle their names into non-conflicting 8.3 format and link them to a given
directory on a TVFS (virtual) partition.  It will also change such
characters as '(space)','+','[',']',';','=' and ',' that are FAT
incompatible to apropriate "equivalents".  A whole drive can be mapped this
way without touching your original files!!

It takes the first 8 characters of a filename and the first 3 character
after the last dot in that filename to constitute a DOS compatible
filename.  Periods in the first 8 characters will be elimated.  Incompatible
characters will be vaporised.  Then, some filename conflict checking will be
made, and if found, it will stamp a ~# before the period or at the end of
the filename to differiciate them.  On HPFS, since filenames are always in
alphanumeric order, ~# will be incremented by their respective long
filename sorting order.  BEWARE!!  SFN.CMD makes no directory checking, it
will FAIL miserably if either realpath or virtualpath doesn't exist.

The program isn't super fast.  The main reason being that I can't use use
TVFS REXX support as it contains a _serious_ flaw:  it doesn't work with
filenames with spaces.  DOH!!!!  Complain to TVFS author.

For myself, I seem to have problem remounting drives (gives garbage) and
unlinking the root dir is a pain in the butt with tvulink -d x: * ...  It's
a miracle TVFS works at all (at least for me).  Well, better than nothing!

Limitations
-----------

- The directories are read only (0 bytes free), although the files are not.
- Renaming is futile.
- There seems to be a problem with % signs in filenames, can't figure out
  why... must be a hidden bug (err feature) in REXX.


I make NO warranty for this code, and everyone is free to do whatever they
want with it... gimme the credits though :)
