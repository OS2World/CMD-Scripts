-----What RAFL does-----

    RAFL is a REXX script which will allow you to pick archive files
from a file list box and then see what files are in them.  It determines
archive type by signature and supports .ZIP, .ARJ and .LZH files.  It is
simple to use.  Just run it and you'll see that it's obvious.  **MAKE
SURE TO READ THE SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS BELOW!  RAFL REQUIRES VREXX, UNARJ,
UNZIP, LH and EPM TO RUN!**


-----First Things First-----

    First of all, RAFL is committed to the public domain.  Free for use by
any who want to use it.  Free for modification by anybody who wants to
modify it.  Free for mangling by anyone who wants to mangle it.

    Second of all, I wrote this to learn about Visual REXX in particular
and REXX scripts in general.  It is not warranteed to do anything but take
up disk space.  And in no way will the author (that's me, Russel Havens) be
liable for any damages, real, consequential, unreal, inconsequential, etc.,
etc., etc., from using this script.  In other words, its on your system, so
what happens there is your doing!

    Now third of all, to be honest, the only "bad" things that even
*could* happen are that 1) RAFL creates a file in the current directory
with the unlikely name of AFL%%TMP.$$$, so it will overwrite any file
with the same name in the current directory. 2) if RAFL doesn't find
VREXX.EXE in the PATH or VREXX.DLL and DEVBASE.DLL in the DPATH, it will
probably freak and you will probably have to close the window.


-----System Requirements-----

    VREXX requires OS/2 2.0 or later, so RAFL does too.  It should do
fine with the minimum OS/2 2.0 requirements for RAM, disk space, etc.

    RAFL requires Visual REXX to be installed.  That means that
VREXX.EXE needs to be in the PATH and VREXX.DLL & DEVBASE.DLL need to be
in the DLL Path (DPATH).

    RAFL does not do its own archive work, so it requires UNZIP.EXE,
UNARJ.EXE and LH.EXE in the PATH.
    UNZIP.EXE was originally written by Samuel H. Smith, but in its
current rev. (version 5.0, out in Aug. '92) has more authors than you can
shake a stick at.
    UNARJ.EXE is a 32-bit port of Robert K. Jung's UNARJ done by Robert
Grey.  It was originally called GNUNARJ, but I renamed mine to be more
like my DOS UNARJ and to shorten the name down a bit, since it is a
command line program and every keystroke saved speeds things up for me.
    LH.EXE is an .LZH compatible archiver copyrighted by A:Ware Inc.
The latest version I have is 2.14, dated 9/19/89.  Still, it works quite
nicely as an archiver.
    These programs are all free for personal use and are available in
their separate archives.
    RAFL also uses EPM.EXE, which is the advanced editor included with
the OS/2 2.0 package.  Needless to say, it needs to be in the path as
well.

-----In Closing-----
    Thank you, IBM for supplying us with OS/2 and REXX!  Thank you, IBM and
Richard B. LAM for supplying us with VREXX!
    I hope this is of use.  Perhaps in the future, I will make RAFL
capable of full archive shell capabilites like SHEZ or ARCMASTER.  Who
knows?  If anybody cares to let me know how wonderful this is,  or
whether to continue work on it or even <gasp> that they don't like RAFL,
drop me a line at:

    In the mean time, ENJOY!
