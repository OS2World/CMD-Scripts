  Swap Monitor allows to monitor the size of the swap file with the purpose
  to determine the optimal value for the "initial" option of the config.sys
  SWAPPATH statement.

  Installation:

  Rename the english.cmd and english.txt files	as swapmon.cmd and swapmon.txt
  and copy them in any directory togther with the swapmon.ico file.

  Usage:

  After having setted the initial value of the swap file size at its minimum
  (for instance: SWAPPATH=C:\OS2\SYSTEM 2048 512), reboot the system and start
  swapmon.cmd.
  
  The program will show on the screen the current and the maximum size of the
  swap file and will write the values in the log file swapmon.log (in the same
  path swapmon.cmd has been started from).

  If you start the program without any parameter the swap file size will be
  checked once per second and will write in swapmon.log just the maximum size
  reached by the swap file.

  The monitoring interval and the logging mode may be changed through the
  program parameteres. The default value for interval is 1 second and the
  default logging mode is to write only one line with the maximum value of
  the swap file size, overwriting it as soon that the previous value has been
  surpassed.

  The first parameter is the interval value, it is facultative and may be
  followed by the logging mode parameter:
  - "/A" (or "-A", "/a" o "-a")
    each time the previous maximum swap file size is surpassed, the new size
    is appended in a new line rather than overwriting the previous line.
  - "/Sn" (oppure "-S", "/s" o "-s")
    the swap file size is written in the log file every "n" minutes. If no value
    is given for "n" then the program uses the default value of 10 minutes.
    The swap file size is written in spite of the fact it is smaller or bigger
    than the previous value and a bar is added on the right in order to allow
    an easy avaluation of the swap file size changements.
  - "/O" or invalid parameters
    means default logging mode.

  Entering as parameter "-?" (or "/?, "/h", "/H, "-h" o "-H") a message about
  the program usage is displayed on the screen.

  The system increases the swap file size as needed, but it usually doesn't
  reduce it as quickly. Perhaps, the best way to get informations about the swap
  file size is by specifing as parameters:
  SWAPMON 30 /S
  At the end of the work day, the program window will show the maximum size reached
  by the swap file, while swapmon.log will allow to check how the swap file size
  has changed during the day.
  The maximum value should be used as the initial parameter in the config.sys	
  SWAPPATH directive unless it has been reached for a very short period, working
  on something unusual or unless you do not have so much free space on the hard
  disk.
