   NOTES    : 

   Dupfind checks for files with duplicate filenames on the selected
   volume.  Dupfind is useful for system troubleshooting and for
   locating redundant files.

   The results are logged to a text file called dupfind.log.  After
   processing is finished the location of dupfind.log will be
   displayed.  If the environment variable LOGFILES is set, as it
   is by default in current versions of eCS, then dupfind will
   respect this setting and place dupfind.log in the location
   specified by LOGFILES.

   Dupfind is a processor intensive utility.  On older systems
   with large volumes the time to process may be lengthy.

   ---

   Installation: Place dupfind.cmd in the directory of
   your choice.  Typing "dupfind /h" at a command line interface
   will display help.

   Future enhancements:

   - nls support.
   - ability to check an entire system instead of only one volume.
