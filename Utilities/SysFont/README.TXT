Default System Font Modifier Utility - From the README file of OS/2 2.1
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Well folks, if you're like me and ABSOLUTELY HATE how Warp/OS2 2.1 uses
System Proportional as the default system font, you'll be glad to know that
this marvelously simple utility can change it to whatever font you specifiy!
BELIEVE IT! :)

You can see evidence of the "System Font" on pushbuttons, help text, and in
some dialog boxes.  All use the 10.System Proportional Font, and dragging
fonts from the font palette to replace them only change that one field.
Nothing permanent.  I'm NOT talking about how OS/2's default scheme uses
10.System Proportional as the font for title bars and menu bars - THAT you
CAN change with the font palette and/or scheme palette.

This will modify your OS2.INI, so make sure to make a backup.  It will prompt
you for the font name you want and the font size.  You must type it exactly
as it is in the font palette, or something bad will happen (I don't know
what yet).  And then presto!  ADIOS TO THAT SYSTEM *^$%#%#%$ FONT!
