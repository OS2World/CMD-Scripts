/* readme  - this is the readme file of the MlRxShl package  20060525 */

MlRxShl provides tools which improve the command-line environment.  But
it's NOT another cmd.exe replacement.

The following text describes the content of this package, and what
features it provides.

This package contains the following files:

   cmdshl.cmd     -- the command shell front end.
   df.cmd         -- an Unix-like DF command.
   file_id.diz    -- a short description used by BBS.
   fl.cmd         -- a filelist-like file manager.
   fl.hlp         -- the fl.cmd online help.
   less.cmd       -- a better more.
   mlrxshl.inf    -- the complete documentation.
   mlrxshl0.ipf   -- the documentation header source code.
   mlrxshl0.inf   -- the documentation header.
   popd.cmd       -- a 'pop dir' command.
   profile.fl     -- a FL profile sample.
   profile.shl    -- a CMDSHL profile sample.
   profile1.shl   -- a commented version of PROFILE.SHL.
   pushd.cmd      -- a 'push dir' command.
   query.cmd      -- extracts various information from %ETC%\connect.log
   readme         -- this file!
   rexxvio.dll    -- the text-mode interface for REXX.
   rexxvio.old    -- the text-mode interface for REXX (no >2GB support).
   sdir.cmd       -- puts some colors in your directory listings.
   whence.cmd     -- find a file along a path (PATH by default).


FEATURES:
=========

   The five provided tools are completely independent.

 CmdShl
 ------

   CmdShl is a command interpreter front-end.  It provides improved
   editing commands, alias, filename completion, ...

   It can use cmd.exe, 4os2.exe or any other command interpreter which
   provides a Rexx environment.

 Fl.cmd
 ------

   Fl is yet another character-mode file manager.  It mimics the
   features of FILELIST.

 less.cmd
 --------

   Less is (yet another) better more.  This one can act as a filter or
   as a command, allows horizontal and vertical scrolling, can locate
   specific text strings, ..., and, most of all, has a much faster
   display speed than more.exe.

   And less.cmd is so small (less than 2Kb :-)...

 SDir.cmd
 --------

   SDir is a drop-in replacement for the default DIR command.  It
   provides user-definable highlighting.

 Query.cmd
 ---------

   QUERY is a command used to extract various data.  It is especially
   useful if you are using Ultimedia Mail/Lite as your mail reader or
   IBM Global Network as your Internet provider.  It was created to
   simply obtain data that were concealed or not otherwise directly
   available.


INSTALLATION:
=============

   Unpack the archive in a temporary directory and read the online help
   for details on how to install the features you are interested in by
   issuing the following command:
