Caveats:

1.  This program only works for 3.5" High Density diskettes.
    There isn't enough room on a 5.25" diskette for the files I use anyway.
2.  It has to be your A: drive. If you don't have a 3.5" A: drive, you are
    not going to be able to use the boot diskette.
3.  Also unfortunately it does not work with PS/2 systems. Sorry. Some of the
    PS/2 files are different and I don't have any way to test that
    configuration.

Installation:

    Unzip the file makeboot.cmd and place it in your c:\os2\install
    directory.


Use:

    At an OS/2 prompt, type MAKEBOOT<enter> . You will need the 2.11
    distribution diskettes, so have them ready the first time you use
    the program.


Notes:

It is useful to have a small editor on the BOOT DISK. There are
several IBM EWS products. Two that the I know of are TED & T2.
The space left on the boot disk will not be adequate to install the
editor. The files seem to grow a bit with each release. It's getting
to be close to even get the necessary files on the diskette!

You will also want to install chkdsk.com on a diskette so that you can
do a chkdsk from a floppy boot. This is the most common reason for doing
a floppy boot.

I therefore suggest that you format another floppy disk and put CHKDSK.COM
and the VIO text based editor of your choice on this diskette for use when 
you boot from your bootable floppy.

License Cost:

For private use,the program is yours to use without charge. However, if 
you wish to send me gift, I will accept it.<g>

For commercial use, there is a charge of $10.00 Canadian. I will also accept 
American funds.

Enjoy!
