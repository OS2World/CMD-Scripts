Simple REXX script to mimic a cuckoo clock
==========================================

This very simple and straightforward REXX script shows how to create a cuckoo
clock that beats the hours and half hours on an OS/2 machine with a SoundBlaster.
The sound playback facility depends on the SBOS2.SYS SoundBlaster driver and the
associated PLAYER.EXE program, but these programs can be replaced by something
else very easily -- just look into the script!

You should put the CUCKOO.CMD script in the same directory as the PLAYER.EXE
command and the CUCKOO.RAW sound file. Then, enter

[OS2 prompt] detach cuckoo

or find another way to push the program into the background. Running it in a
window is possible but will produce little output and consume more resources.

The script will calculate how long it should sleep before reaching the next beat
time and call DosSleep to be rescheduled at that time. So, it consumes *NO* CPU
time whatsoever while waiting.

Then it calculates how often it should beat, constructs a sound file that
contains the appropriate number of beats and uses PLAYER.EXE to actually play the
sound. OS/2 is good enough to do this without noticeable system performance
drop. You'll hear the disk rumble a bit, though  :-)

View this script as an example of how to do nice things with REXX that have
always be hard to program on other Intel-based systems.

Please enhance this script and make as many changes as possible. REXX is powerful
enough to satisfy most of your wishes :-)
