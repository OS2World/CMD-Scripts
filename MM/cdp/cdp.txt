CD Player backup/restore
========================


DISCLAIMER:

This program is free, without warranty of any kind.
The use of this program implies that you use it at

possibility of such damages.


Introduction:
=============
With CDP you can list, backup and restore information from the CDP.INI
file, where The Warp4 CD-player stores CD and Track titles.
The backup file is a readable and editable ASCII file.

It is also possible to add songtitles to a backup file with an ASCII 
editor like e(pm) or the internal editor from File Commander and restore 
this to the CDP.INI file.


Installation:
=============
CDP consists only of one OS/2 Rexx program file, CDP.CMD.
Copy it in a directory where you want to use it or in a 
directory in your search path.
The CDP.INI file is searched first in the current directory
(So you can work on a copy) and next in the the directory pointed
to by the 'MMBASE' setting in the CONFIG.SYS.
This is usually the \MMOS2 directory on your boot drive.
CDP will show where it found this file.
Other input and output files are expected and 
created in the current directory.


Options:
========
These options are available:

- List all or selected CD titles
- List all or selected CD titles with track titles
- Save CD data in readable ASCII backup file for all or selected CD's.
- Restore saved data back to CDP.INI file.

The scope of listings can be narrowed by including 
only CD titles containing a search string.

The most important feature, for which I wrote this thing in the first place,
is to backup CD titles in the editable ASCII form, edit the file and paste 
track titles from another source (like the internet) into it and restore
the result back to the Warp4 CD player ini-file.

In a similar way you can exchange CD data with friends or from pc to pc.

******************************************************************************
** PLEASE NOTE: When restoring CD data, existing data for that CD is lost.  **
** Other data than Title and Track info is not saved and thus not restored. **
** Known other data is the last play position and Programmed Tracks         **
******************************************************************************

Usage:
======

Note: You cannot use CDP while the Warp4 CD-Player is running.

CDP             Lists all Titles
CDP string      Lists Titles containing 'string'
CDP -l          Lists all Titles and tracks
CDP -l string   Lists Titles containing 'string' and tracks
CDP -x          Saves CD data for all titles to file CDP.OUT
CDP -x string   Saves CD data for titles containing 'string' to file CDP.OUT
CDP -a          Restores CD data from file CDP.INP

Search strings are not case sensitive.

As the Warp4 CD Player does not record artist names, you have no way
of selecting on artist. To overcome this, start the CD Title with an
abbreviation followed with an ":" for that artist.
For example, Zappa: Does Humor Belong In Music?
Now you can list all cd's for that particular artist with: CDP zappa:

The file format for files CDP.INP and CDP.OUT is identical:
--------------------------
[cd code] CD Title
 1 Track title
 2 Track title

[cd code] Next CD Title
 1 Track title
 2 Track title
--------------------------
An empty line or end-of-file marks the end of data for the CD.


With the -a (Restore) option you have to confirm the update:

Ready to write to E:\rex\cdp\cdp.ini
Continue?  Yes, Skip, All, Quit

Choose:
 Y to update or add this CD
 S to skip this CD
 A to update or add this CD and all other defined cd's in the input file
 Q to quit


History:
========
In about two years working with Warp3, I typed in many CD Titles for the
accompanying CD-Player to realize all was gone after installing Warp4.
So I didn't bother to type in anything again... Till I recently found out
that the Warp4 CD Player also could maintain and display Track Titles.
If I could find a way to easily enter all those track titles I already
own in various files. Time to play with the Rexx 'sysini' function.
After one evening figuring out and another evening to get things right
CDP.CMD was the result. It fits my needs, may be it fits others needs to.
So here it is!
