If a previous cdrwsel was install, You can keep the cdrwsel.ini file 
but i suggest you to install new cdrwsel into a different directory.
* Delete the current icon and if you are using a trash cam, don't 
  forget to destroy the cdrwsel program icon or new creation will
  fail. 
  original inscdrw1.cmd works (same as under previous cdrwsel release)
  but this update one should prevent from a possible faulse error 
  message
