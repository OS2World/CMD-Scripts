                     Grin's Simple MIDi Jukeboxx
                     ============================

                     Version 2.60
                     1997 February


           This program is freeware for non-commercial environments



        Hello music lovers!


This is my attempt to stop my anger because IBM's MIDi player is
unable to use playlists. This simple player plays all MIDi files
in the actual directory (or anywhere if you enter it on command
line or in a playlist file), then stops. 


         About the REXX language
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I wrote it in REXX because it's completely fits the purpose. So you
got the sources, too. ;-) Feel free to read the code, or modify if
you like, but please do not distribute modified versions but send
them to me, I will distribute them if they worth it. ;-)

The program uses very low CPU since it "sleeps" most of the time.
Don't worry when you press a key and nothing happens: the program
checks the input only in every seconds, and so refreshes the screen.
(On my machine it uses as low as 7% or the CPU.)

The program usage is in the REXX source, just check it. But you
can simply start the program in a directory where some *.MID file
resides.


         The secret key
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Well, not REALLY secret. It have no button, that's all. It's the DELETE
function. If you enter /D switch (it's called "prevent the careless user
to run in circles and scream switch") then you can press the D key anytime
a file plays, and after the extra-safety-check the file's gone for ever
(or at least until the next CHKDSK/F:3). 

Just listen-and-kill. :-)

         
         Some volume tricks
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you're in a night family environment :) you should check the source
for the starting volume and lower it if you're that lazy to make your
500+ watts stereo more quiet... :-) You can set it anytime on command
line, though.

I especially wonder whether there is any soundcard able to set the
volume in stereo. Mine (Gravis Ultrasound) seem to have a driver
unable to do that. Others reported that theirs are also unable to
do it. I try to detect the sound card's ability and use stereo only
when it's supported, but... I don't _know_ that it's correct as I
wrote it. :)


         Usage
         ~~~~~~~

    MidPlay [<file pattern>] [@<playlist name>] [<file pattern>] [switches]
  
  Switches:  /?        FIRE! No? Then: HELP! (You suspected that, didn't you?)
             /V<vol>   Set global volume (0-100)
             /R<vol>   Set right volume (0-100, stereo capable only)
             /L<vol>   Set left  volume (0-100, stereo capable only)
             /S        Shuffle play - play songs in random order
             /P        Show full path+filename of musics
             /D        Enable (D)elete key. You can wipe off the
                       worst musical terrors your harddisk with smile. :-)
             /F<fname> Save internally built playlist into a file. It will
                       contain all command-line entered file, automatically
                       found names, etc. Good one. 

You can use file patterns like names in actual directory ("YELLOW.MID"),
full path ("C:\OOKIE\AmericanPie.Mid"), wildcards ("C:\ATS\*.mid").

Playlists are simple text files containing one filename in a line,
unlimited lines. Names could contain full path or just the name, but
not wildcards. (You shouldn't be THAT lazy! :-))

Names contain spaces ought to be surrounded by quotes. If you omit them,
well, just try to imagine. :-) [Playlist should not care since only command
line processing chokes on the spaces.]

The order of patterns, playlists and switches are irrelevant. 
                                                      -- Midplay of Borg
 
  Examples:
    MidPlay
      Plays all *.MID files in the current directory
 
    MidPlay /S E:\TMP\MIDI\A*.MID M:\IDI\"C64 Evergreens"\*
      Plays the given files of the given directory, shuffled
 
    MidPlay TheSatan.Mid @hellish.list /v80 /p
      Plays the Satan's song then all files in the playlist, volume 80%,
      and show full path and filenames


         What's new, history, etc
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Why do you ask me? Check the source! :-) 
(You got all my sources, remember? :))


         Standard worm...er... lawyer stuff
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The program is free if you run it in an environment where no commerce
has gone before! :-) But since I'm a poor Hungarian guy I always
accept donations in money, food, drink, computer parts or girls. ;-)
You can contact me at the addresses below. (I can accept cash or 
bankchecks only.) [Girls should be pre-validated by photograph ;->]

If you're a commercial user please support me (and the development
of several OS/2 programs) and send an amount as low as USD 10 to my
address as a registration fee. (You can send more of course, even you
won't, but people always hope wonders. :-))

Of course you don't want to tell me that you want any guarantees from
a FREE program, do you? But the program usually plays what it should,
and that's more than the Warp's current players do. :) If it deletes
your CD drive, eats your lunch or take your sister to a movie - bad 
luck. :-> You have my full sympathy.

My support is virtual. That means I support any requests unless 
I'm swapped out because lack of time. :-)


         Your support!
         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

I'd like to hear about you! Send me a mail about how did you like
this piece of code! 

Hey!! ANYONE USES THIS DAMN PROGRAM?? :-)) Use your electronic mail features
and sound your opinion, pal!


Happy Jukeboxxing!
