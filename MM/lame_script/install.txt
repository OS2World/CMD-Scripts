Lame Script
===========

Description: 
------------

This REXX script encodes multiple wave files to a 
destination directoy using the Lame encoder.
Also the elapsed time to encode all files is displayed
at the end of the process.
             
Installation:
-------------

Copy the file start160.cmd to the directory where Lame
is installed.

Usage : 
-------

start160.cmd 'source directory' 'destination directory'

When there are no parameters start160.cmd will default to :

DefaultSourceDir 		= 'H:\WAVE'
DefaultDestinationDir 	= 'M:\'

These directories can be changed by editing start160.cmd.
Also the options passed to Lame can be edited.

Default 160 kbits/sec and -h option for better quality.
