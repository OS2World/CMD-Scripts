After editing Time.CMD I suggest to rename it to something like MP3.CMD, 
but only if you're fully aware of the fact that Time.CMD assumes the use
of a fixed drive letter and directory (the "usbdrive" variable). Time is 
a FAT MP3 player-brand, and you cannot execute Time accidently by typing
"time". Hence the 

Yet another unexpected prompt may be the deletion of e.g. M:\*.*. That's 
perhaps not as safe as deleting *.MP3 or files synchronisation, but this
requires you to pay attention to the destruction. Please note it'll also 
delete other files, e.g. a backup or some PDF file.


WARNING: you have to edit and check lines 5, 6 and 7 of Time.CMD first.


Line 5:
=======

   mp3='C:\Susan\Multimedia\Music'       

This should point to the base directory of your MP3 file library. Do not    
add a trailing "\", so use "A:" if your base directory is "A:\".
   

Line 6:
=======

   size=256                            
   
This is the size, in MiB, of your device. In general it's recommended to
exceed the real size of its storage capacity. That way Time.CMD will try
to copy more files to the device, so it's more likely that Time.CMD will 
use all free space.

This number of MiBs is not a limit. If the real free storage capacity of
your device is less, then Time.CMD may result in a few "disk full"-error
messages. That's okay, because each failed attempt was an opportunity to
try to use the last free MiBs of your device's storage capacity.

If the number of MiBs is less than the real storage capacity, then it is
possible that Time.CMD will exceed the limit by the size of your largest
MP3 file.


Line 7:
=======

   usbdrive='B:\'                      
   
This is the target drive *AND* directory of the MP3 player, so it always
has to end with a "\". Please note that Time.MP3 will always assume that
this is the right drive and directory. If it's the wrong drive, then the
prompt when Time.CMD tries to delete e.g. B:\*.* is your final chance to
avoid having to restore your backup files.


By the way: the purpose of Time.CMD is to copy MP3 files, with any short 
or long filename, to a device like a 256 MiB MP3 player which uses a FAT
file system, with or without an ability to play files in a random order.
E.g. "C:\Susan\Multimedia\Music\Dixie\Elvis Presley - Dead or alive.MP3"
will, if randomly selected and assuming enough free storage capacity, be
copied to B:\000001A0.MP3. If it's the first copied file, then it should
be the first MP3 file the player will play. "It worked for me".


You'll also have to delete lines 8 and 9, once. Line 8 prints a message,
which points to reading this file. Line 9 exits before any damage can be
caused. This are/were the lines you have/had to delete:

   SAY 'Please read TIME.TXT first, you have to edit this file.'
   EXIT
